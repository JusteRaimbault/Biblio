										abstract = {Probing functional interactions among the nodes in a network is crucial to understanding how complex systems work. Existing methodologies widely assume static network structures or Gaussian statistics or do not take account of likely sparse interactions. They are therefore not well-suited to neuronal spiking data with rapid task-dependent dynamics, binary statistics, and sparse functional dependencies. We develop an inference framework for extracting functional network dynamics from neuronal data by integrating techniques from adaptive filtering, compressed sensing, point processes, and high-dimensional statistics. We derive efficient estimation algorithms and precise statistical inference procedures. We apply our proposed techniques to experimentally recorded neuronal data to probe the neuronal functional networks underlying attentive behavior. Our techniques provide substantial gains in computation, resolution, and statistical robustness.Quantifying the functional relations between the nodes in a network based on local observations is a key challenge in studying complex systems. Most existing time series analysis techniques for this purpose provide static estimates of the network properties, pertain to stationary Gaussian data, or do not take into account the ubiquitous sparsity in the underlying functional networks. When applied to spike recordings from neuronal ensembles undergoing rapid task-dependent dynamics, they thus hinder a precise statistical characterization of the dynamic neuronal functional networks underlying adaptive behavior. We develop a dynamic estimation and inference paradigm for extracting functional neuronal network dynamics in the sense of Granger, by integrating techniques from adaptive filtering, compressed sensing, point process theory, and high-dimensional statistics. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed paradigm through theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and application to synthetic and real data. Application of our techniques to two-photon Ca2+ imaging experiments from the mouse auditory cortex reveals unique features of the functional neuronal network structures underlying spontaneous activity at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Our analysis of simultaneous recordings from the ferret auditory and prefrontal cortical areas suggests evidence for the role of rapid top-down and bottom-up functional dynamics across these areas involved in robust attentive behavior.},
