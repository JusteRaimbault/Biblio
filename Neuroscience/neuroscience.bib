	abstract = {Humans and animals are capable of rapid learning from a small dataset, which is still difficult for artificial neural networks. Recent studies further suggest that our learning speed is nearly optimal given a stream of information, but its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we hypothesized that the elaborate connection structure between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites is the key element for this near-optimal learning and derived a data-efficient rule for dendritic synaptic plasticity and rewiring from Bayesian theory. We implemented this rule in a detailed neuron model of visual perceptual learning and found that the model well reproduces various known properties of dendritic plasticity and synaptic organization in cortical neurons.Recent experimental studies suggest that, in cortical microcircuits of the mammalian brain, the majority of neuron-to-neuron connections are realized by multiple synapses. However, it is not known whether such redundant synaptic connections provide any functional benefit. Here, we show that redundant synaptic connections enable near-optimal learning in cooperation with synaptic rewiring. By constructing a simple dendritic neuron model, we demonstrate that with multisynaptic connections synaptic plasticity approximates a sample-based Bayesian filtering algorithm known as particle filtering, and wiring plasticity implements its resampling process. Extending the proposed framework to a detailed single-neuron model of perceptual learning in the primary visual cortex, we show that the model accounts for many experimental observations. In particular, the proposed model reproduces the dendritic position dependence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity and the functional synaptic organization on the dendritic tree based on the stimulus selectivity of presynaptic neurons. Our study provides a conceptual framework for synaptic plasticity and rewiring.},

										abstract = {Probing functional interactions among the nodes in a network is crucial to understanding how complex systems work. Existing methodologies widely assume static network structures or Gaussian statistics or do not take account of likely sparse interactions. They are therefore not well-suited to neuronal spiking data with rapid task-dependent dynamics, binary statistics, and sparse functional dependencies. We develop an inference framework for extracting functional network dynamics from neuronal data by integrating techniques from adaptive filtering, compressed sensing, point processes, and high-dimensional statistics. We derive efficient estimation algorithms and precise statistical inference procedures. We apply our proposed techniques to experimentally recorded neuronal data to probe the neuronal functional networks underlying attentive behavior. Our techniques provide substantial gains in computation, resolution, and statistical robustness.Quantifying the functional relations between the nodes in a network based on local observations is a key challenge in studying complex systems. Most existing time series analysis techniques for this purpose provide static estimates of the network properties, pertain to stationary Gaussian data, or do not take into account the ubiquitous sparsity in the underlying functional networks. When applied to spike recordings from neuronal ensembles undergoing rapid task-dependent dynamics, they thus hinder a precise statistical characterization of the dynamic neuronal functional networks underlying adaptive behavior. We develop a dynamic estimation and inference paradigm for extracting functional neuronal network dynamics in the sense of Granger, by integrating techniques from adaptive filtering, compressed sensing, point process theory, and high-dimensional statistics. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed paradigm through theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and application to synthetic and real data. Application of our techniques to two-photon Ca2+ imaging experiments from the mouse auditory cortex reveals unique features of the functional neuronal network structures underlying spontaneous activity at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Our analysis of simultaneous recordings from the ferret auditory and prefrontal cortical areas suggests evidence for the role of rapid top-down and bottom-up functional dynamics across these areas involved in robust attentive behavior.},
