	abstract = {Infection with multiple parasite species is common and the majority of coinfections involve at least one long-lasting infection. Our data-driven model of chronic coinfection dynamics shows that accurate prediction at the population level requires quantifying both the individual-level transmission and mortality consequences of coinfection. The infections characterized in this study compete at the population level. When one pathogen facilitates both the transmission and progression of the second pathogen, the prevalence of the first pathogen is reduced. This mechanism of competition is unique compared with previously described mechanisms and occurs without cross-immunity, resource competition within the host, or convalescence. We recommend assessing the generality of this mechanism, which could have important consequences for other chronic, immunosuppressive pathogens such as HIV or TB.Coinfecting parasites and pathogens remain a leading challenge for global public health due to their consequences for individual-level infection risk and disease progression. However, a clear understanding of the population-level consequences of coinfection is lacking. Here, we constructed a model that includes three individual-level effects of coinfection: mortality, fecundity, and transmission. We used the model to investigate how these individual-level consequences of coinfection scale up to produce population-level infection patterns. To parameterize this model, we conducted a 4-y cohort study in African buffalo to estimate the individual-level effects of coinfection with two bacterial pathogens, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and brucellosis, across a range of demographic and environmental contexts. At the individual level, our empirical results identified bTB as a risk factor for acquiring brucellosis, but we found no association between brucellosis and the risk of acquiring bTB. Both infections were associated with reductions in survival and neither infection was associated with reductions in fecundity. The model reproduced coinfection patterns in the data and predicted opposite impacts of coinfection at individual and population scales: Whereas bTB facilitated brucellosis infection at the individual level, our model predicted the presence of brucellosis to have a strong negative impact on bTB at the population level. In modeled populations where brucellosis was present, the endemic prevalence and basic reproduction number (R0) of bTB were lower than in populations without brucellosis. Therefore, these results provide a data-driven example of competition between coinfecting pathogens that occurs when one pathogen facilitates secondary infections at the individual level.},
