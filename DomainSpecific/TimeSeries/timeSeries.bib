abstract="Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known technique to find an optimal alignment between two given (time-dependent) sequences under certain restrictions (Fig. 4.1). Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a nonlinear fashion to match each other. Originally, DTW has been used to compare different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition, see [170]. In fields such as data mining and information retrieval, DTW has been successfully applied to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data.",
