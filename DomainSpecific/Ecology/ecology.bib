	abstract = {Urban environments are expanding worldwide, impacting the populations of many organisms. Understanding how and why species are affected by urbanization is thus an important goal. We examined the role of direct competitive interactions among species on the response of bird species to urbanization. We found evidence that urban-adapted, subordinate species were less widespread in cities than closely related dominant species, but only when dominant and subordinate species live together, which suggests that direct competitive interactions reduce the ability of subordinate species to persist in cities. This result depended on the level of economic development of the country, suggesting that economic development may heighten the effects of competition on subordinate species, thereby reducing species diversity in cities.Urbanization represents an extreme transformation of more natural systems. Populations of most species decline or disappear with urbanization, and yet some species persist and even thrive in cities. What determines which species persist or thrive in urban habitats? Direct competitive interactions among species can influence their distributions and resource use, particularly along gradients of environmental challenge. Given the challenges of urbanization, similar interactions may be important for determining which species persist or thrive in cities; however, their role remains poorly understood. Here, we use a global dataset to test among three alternative hypotheses for how direct competitive interactions and behavioral dominance may influence the breeding occurrence of birds in cities. We find evidence to support the competitive interference hypothesis: behaviorally dominant species were more widespread in urban habitats than closely related subordinate species, but only in taxa that thrive in urban environments (hereafter, urban adapted), and only when dominant and subordinate species overlapped their geographic ranges. This result was evident across diverse phylogenetic groups but varied significantly with a country{\textquoteright}s level of economic development. Urban-adapted, dominant species were more widespread than closely related subordinate species in cities in developed, but not developing, countries; countries in economic transition showed an intermediate pattern. Our results provide evidence that competitive interactions broadly influence species responses to urbanization, and that these interactions have asymmetric effects on subordinate species that otherwise could be widespread in urban environments. Results further suggest that economic development might accentuate the consequences of competitive interactions, thereby reducing local diversity in cities.},

	abstract = {Over 50 years ago, Dan Janzen proposed an integrative framework relating latitudinal differences in climate variability to elevational trends in species diversity. We show that tropical species in three independent insect clades have (i) narrower thermal breadths, (ii) decreased dispersal and higher population structure, and (iii) higher cryptic diversity and speciation rates. This research tests all of the key predictions of Janzen{\textquoteright}s hypothesis in related taxa. Our work advances the understanding of how climate variability shapes global diversity patterns, moving beyond simple correlations, to mechanistic links between climate, local adaptation, dispersal, and montane species richness.Species richness is greatest in the tropics, and much of this diversity is concentrated in mountains. Janzen proposed that reduced seasonal temperature variation selects for narrower thermal tolerances and limited dispersal along tropical elevation gradients [Janzen DH (1967) Am Nat 101:233{\textendash}249]. These locally adapted traits should, in turn, promote reproductive isolation and higher speciation rates in tropical mountains compared with temperate ones. Here, we show that tropical and temperate montane stream insects have diverged in thermal tolerance and dispersal capacity, two key traits that are drivers of isolation in montane populations. Tropical species in each of three insect clades have markedly narrower thermal tolerances and lower dispersal than temperate species, resulting in significantly greater population divergence, higher cryptic diversity, higher tropical speciation rates, and greater accumulation of species over time. Our study also indicates that tropical montane species, with narrower thermal tolerance and reduced dispersal ability, will be especially vulnerable to rapid climate change.},

	abstract = {Organisms leave traces of DNA in their environment [environmental DNA (eDNA)], such as cells in mucus or feces. When extracted from water or soil, eDNA can be used to track the presence of a target species or the composition of entire communities. In rivers, eDNA dynamics are modulated by transport and decay. Here, we use hydrologically based models to reconstruct the upstream distribution and abundance of target species throughout a river network from eDNA measurements. We validate our method by estimating the catchment-wide biomass distribution of a sessile invertebrate and its parasite, causing disease in salmonids. This work unlocks the power of eDNA for monitoring biodiversity across broad geographies in a way hitherto unfeasible with traditional survey approaches.All organisms leave traces of DNA in their environment. This environmental DNA (eDNA) is often used to track occurrence patterns of target species. Applications are especially promising in rivers, where eDNA can integrate information about populations upstream. The dispersion of eDNA in rivers is modulated by complex processes of transport and decay through the dendritic river network, and we currently lack a method to extract quantitative information about the location and density of populations contributing to the eDNA signal. Here, we present a general framework to reconstruct the upstream distribution and abundance of a target species across a river network, based on observed eDNA concentrations and hydro-geomorphological features of the network. The model captures well the catchment-wide spatial biomass distribution of two target species: a sessile invertebrate (the bryozoan Fredericella sultana) and its parasite (the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae). Our method is designed to easily integrate general biological and hydrological data and to enable spatially explicit estimates of the distribution of sessile and mobile species in fluvial ecosystems based on eDNA sampling.},
