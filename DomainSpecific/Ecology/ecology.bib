	abstract = {Groundwater ecosystems deliver services that are vital to human well-being and environmental quality. Overexploitation of groundwater threatens biodiversity and ecosystem stability worldwide, underscoring the need to discover, describe, and sustain groundwater-dependent species before they are lost. Here we present a phylogenomic analysis of a salamander radiation endemic to the karstic Edwards{\textendash}Trinity aquifer system of west-central Texas. This intensively used resource sustains narrow-range endemic groundwater species that are endangered with extinction due to aquifer overdraft. The federal Endangered Species Act has been used as a tool to bring regulation to groundwater withdrawal, but existing state law that treats groundwater as private property undermines conservation. Without ecologically relevant policies for sustainable use, unchecked groundwater depletion will likely result in species extinction and ecosystem degradation.Groundwater-dependent species are among the least-known components of global biodiversity, as well as some of the most vulnerable because of rapid groundwater depletion at regional and global scales. The karstic Edwards{\textendash}Trinity aquifer system of west-central Texas is one of the most species-rich groundwater systems in the world, represented by dozens of endemic groundwater-obligate species with narrow, naturally fragmented distributions. Here, we examine how geomorphological and hydrogeological processes have driven population divergence and speciation in a radiation of salamanders (Eurycea) endemic to the Edwards{\textendash}Trinity system using phylogenetic and population genetic analysis of genome-wide DNA sequence data. Results revealed complex patterns of isolation and reconnection driven by surface and subsurface hydrology, resulting in both adaptive and nonadaptive population divergence and speciation. Our results uncover cryptic species diversity and refine the borders of several threatened and endangered species. The US Endangered Species Act has been used to bring state regulation to unrestricted groundwater withdrawals in the Edwards (Balcones Fault Zone) Aquifer, where listed species are found. However, the Trinity and Edwards{\textendash}Trinity (Plateau) aquifers harbor additional species with similarly small ranges that currently receive no protection from regulatory programs designed to prevent groundwater depletion. Based on regional climate models that predict increased air temperature, together with hydrologic models that project decreased springflow, we conclude that Edwards{\textendash}Trinity salamanders and other codistributed groundwater-dependent organisms are highly vulnerable to extinction within the next century.},

	abstract = {Coexistence of species depends on two very general mechanisms. In one, species differentiate in their niches and coexist by negative frequency dependence, in the other they have similar niches and cooccur for long periods of time due to (quasi-) equivalence. These explanations ignore the role of local adaptive evolution. We model how local evolution-mediated priority effects (where species that recolonize patches can adapt sufficiently well to resist being displaced by later colonists) affect coexistence in a landscape. We find that evolution often leads to a situation where local patches are strongly dominated by a single species even though all species can be found in any habitat type. This unsuspected result may explain why coexistence of species is often scale dependent.Biodiversity in natural systems can be maintained either because niche differentiation among competitors facilitates stable coexistence or because equal fitness among neutral species allows for their long-term cooccurrence despite a slow drift toward extinction. Whereas the relative importance of these two ecological mechanisms has been well-studied in the absence of evolution, the role of local adaptive evolution in maintaining biological diversity through these processes is less clear. Here we study the contribution of local adaptive evolution to coexistence in a landscape of interconnected patches subject to disturbance. Under these conditions, early colonists to empty patches may adapt to local conditions sufficiently fast to prevent successful colonization by other preadapted species. Over the long term, the iteration of these local-scale priority effects results in niche convergence of species at the regional scale even though species tend to monopolize local patches. Thus, the dynamics evolve from stable coexistence through niche differentiation to neutral cooccurrence at the landscape level while still maintaining strong local niche segregation. Our results show that neutrality can emerge at the regional scale from local, niche-based adaptive evolution, potentially resolving why ecologists often observe neutral distribution patterns at the landscape level despite strong niche divergence among local communities.},

	abstract = {A key problem for complex systems is achieving resilience through their (often nonlinear) interactions between components. Social insect colonies are natural examples of highly scalable systems that achieve homeostatic self-regulation based on local interactions. We describe a {\textquotedblleft}functional core model{\textquotedblright} that we identified in three different insect societies (wasps, ants, and honey bees). This core model is based on self-regulation through a shared (limited) substance that works as an information center and as a buffer system simultaneously. This system has several adaptive properties, as it is robust against environmental disturbances and insensitive against parameter changes. Finding such a {\textquotedblleft}common core model{\textquotedblright} is of high significance in understanding the discrete transitions from individuality to sociality in several animal species through convergent evolution.Homeostatic self-regulation is a fundamental aspect of open dissipative systems. Integral feedback has been found to be important for homeostatic control on both the cellular and molecular levels of biological organization and in engineered systems. Analyzing the task allocation mechanisms of three insect societies, we identified a model of integral control residing at colony level. We characterized a general functional core mechanism, called the {\textquotedblleft}common stomach,{\textquotedblright} where a crucial shared substance for colony function self-regulates its own quantity via reallocating the colony{\textquoteright}s workforce, which collects and uses this substance. The central component in a redundant feedback network is the saturation level of this substance in the colony. An interaction network of positive and negative feedback loops ensures the homeostatic state of this substance and the workforce involved in processing this substance. Extensive sensitivity and stability analyses of the core model revealed that the system is very resilient against perturbations and compensates for specific types of stress that real colonies face in their ecosystems. The core regulation system is highly scalable, and due to its buffer function, it can filter noise and find a new equilibrium quickly after environmental (supply) or colony-state (demand) changes. The common stomach regulation system is an example of convergent evolution among the three different societies, and we predict that similar integral control regulation mechanisms have evolved frequently within natural complex systems.},

	abstract = {Urban environments are expanding worldwide, impacting the populations of many organisms. Understanding how and why species are affected by urbanization is thus an important goal. We examined the role of direct competitive interactions among species on the response of bird species to urbanization. We found evidence that urban-adapted, subordinate species were less widespread in cities than closely related dominant species, but only when dominant and subordinate species live together, which suggests that direct competitive interactions reduce the ability of subordinate species to persist in cities. This result depended on the level of economic development of the country, suggesting that economic development may heighten the effects of competition on subordinate species, thereby reducing species diversity in cities.Urbanization represents an extreme transformation of more natural systems. Populations of most species decline or disappear with urbanization, and yet some species persist and even thrive in cities. What determines which species persist or thrive in urban habitats? Direct competitive interactions among species can influence their distributions and resource use, particularly along gradients of environmental challenge. Given the challenges of urbanization, similar interactions may be important for determining which species persist or thrive in cities; however, their role remains poorly understood. Here, we use a global dataset to test among three alternative hypotheses for how direct competitive interactions and behavioral dominance may influence the breeding occurrence of birds in cities. We find evidence to support the competitive interference hypothesis: behaviorally dominant species were more widespread in urban habitats than closely related subordinate species, but only in taxa that thrive in urban environments (hereafter, urban adapted), and only when dominant and subordinate species overlapped their geographic ranges. This result was evident across diverse phylogenetic groups but varied significantly with a country{\textquoteright}s level of economic development. Urban-adapted, dominant species were more widespread than closely related subordinate species in cities in developed, but not developing, countries; countries in economic transition showed an intermediate pattern. Our results provide evidence that competitive interactions broadly influence species responses to urbanization, and that these interactions have asymmetric effects on subordinate species that otherwise could be widespread in urban environments. Results further suggest that economic development might accentuate the consequences of competitive interactions, thereby reducing local diversity in cities.},

We show that tropical species in three independent insect clades have (i) narrower thermal breadths, (ii) decreased dispersal and higher population structure, and (iii) higher cryptic diversity and speciation rates. This research tests all of the key predictions of Janzen{\textquoteright}s hypothesis in related taxa. Our work advances the understanding of how climate variability shapes global diversity patterns, moving beyond simple correlations, to mechanistic links between climate, local adaptation, dispersal, and montane species richness.Species richness is greatest in the tropics, and much of this diversity is concentrated in mountains. Janzen proposed that reduced seasonal temperature variation selects for narrower thermal tolerances and limited dispersal along tropical elevation gradients [Janzen DH (1967) Am Nat 101:233{\textendash}249]. These locally adapted traits should, in turn, promote reproductive isolation and higher speciation rates in tropical mountains compared with temperate ones. Here, we show that tropical and temperate montane stream insects have diverged in thermal tolerance and dispersal capacity, two key traits that are drivers of isolation in montane populations. Tropical species in each of three insect clades have markedly narrower thermal tolerances and lower dispersal than temperate species, resulting in significantly greater population divergence, higher cryptic diversity, higher tropical speciation rates, and greater accumulation of species over time. Our study also indicates that tropical montane species, with narrower thermal tolerance and reduced dispersal ability, will be especially vulnerable to rapid climate change.},

	abstract = {Organisms leave traces of DNA in their environment [environmental DNA (eDNA)], such as cells in mucus or feces. When extracted from water or soil, eDNA can be used to track the presence of a target species or the composition of entire communities. In rivers, eDNA dynamics are modulated by transport and decay. Here, we use hydrologically based models to reconstruct the upstream distribution and abundance of target species throughout a river network from eDNA measurements. We validate our method by estimating the catchment-wide biomass distribution of a sessile invertebrate and its parasite, causing disease in salmonids. This work unlocks the power of eDNA for monitoring biodiversity across broad geographies in a way hitherto unfeasible with traditional survey approaches.All organisms leave traces of DNA in their environment. This environmental DNA (eDNA) is often used to track occurrence patterns of target species. Applications are especially promising in rivers, where eDNA can integrate information about populations upstream. The dispersion of eDNA in rivers is modulated by complex processes of transport and decay through the dendritic river network, and we currently lack a method to extract quantitative information about the location and density of populations contributing to the eDNA signal. Here, we present a general framework to reconstruct the upstream distribution and abundance of a target species across a river network, based on observed eDNA concentrations and hydro-geomorphological features of the network. The model captures well the catchment-wide spatial biomass distribution of two target species: a sessile invertebrate (the bryozoan Fredericella sultana) and its parasite (the myxozoan Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae). Our method is designed to easily integrate general biological and hydrological data and to enable spatially explicit estimates of the distribution of sessile and mobile species in fluvial ecosystems based on eDNA sampling.},
