	abstract = {Origami, the art of paper folding, is an emerging platform for mechanical metamaterials. Prior work on the design of origami-based structures has focused on simple geometric constructions for limited spaces of origami typologies or global constrained optimization problems that are difficult to solve. Here, we reverse the mathematical, computational, and physical paradigm of origami design by proposing a simple local marching approach that leads to a constructive theorem on the geometry of compatible growth directions at the boundary of a given folded seed. We show how this discovery yields a simple algorithm for the additive design of all developable quadrilateral surfaces, enabling the design of novel foldable metastructures from flat sheets at any scale.Inspired by the allure of additive fabrication, we pose the problem of origami design from a different perspective: How can we grow a folded surface in three dimensions from a seed so that it is guaranteed to be isometric to the plane? We solve this problem in two steps: by first identifying the geometric conditions for the compatible completion of two separate folds into a single developable fourfold vertex, and then showing how this foundation allows us to grow a geometrically compatible front at the boundary of a given folded seed. This yields a complete marching, or additive, algorithm for the inverse design of the complete space of developable quad origami patterns that can be folded from flat sheets. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach by growing ordered, disordered, straight, and curved-folded origami and fitting surfaces of given curvature with folded approximants. Overall, our simple shift in perspective from a global search to a local rule has the potential to transform origami-based metastructure design.Some study data are available in GitHub at https://github.com/garyptchoi/additive-origami.},

	abstract = {Despite great efforts to pursue a safe nuclear energy system during the first nuclear era, which was dominated by developed countries, severe nuclear accidents still occurred. Today, nuclear energy development has entered an unexpected second nuclear era, which is driven by developing countries. This may give rise to a great risk. Nuclear power plants are complex sociotechnical systems, and their safety has never been fully defined. We argue that social aspects, rather than just technical measures, must be involved to ensure nuclear safety. In this paper, the nature of nuclear safety is elucidated with identification of new challenges, and corresponding suggestions are proposed to improve nuclear safety in the unexpected second nuclear era.Nuclear energy development has entered an unexpected second nuclear era, which is mainly driven by developing countries. Despite major efforts to pursue a safe nuclear energy system in the first nuclear era, severe nuclear accidents occurred. A basic problem is that we do not have an adequate understanding of nuclear safety. From the viewpoints of risk and the close coupling of technical and social factors, this paper reexamines the nature of nuclear safety and reviews how previous experts understood it. We also highlight the new challenges that we are likely to confront in the unexpected second nuclear era and clarify some of the refinements that need to be made to the concept of nuclear safety from a sociotechnical perspective. These include the following: 1) Risk decisions should be made based on integrating social and technical elements (i.e., {\textquotedblleft}social rationality{\textquotedblright}); 2) risk needs to be controlled based on the {\textquotedblleft}Wuli{\textendash}Shili{\textendash}Renli{\textquotedblright} framework; 3) systems thinking should be substituted for reductionism in risk assessment, and social mechanisms need to be combined to address uncertainties; and 4) public-centered risk communication should be established. This contribution can provide a theoretical foundation for improving our understanding of the nature of nuclear safety and for transforming the concept of nuclear safety in the unexpected second nuclear era.},
