	abstract = {Many quantities are extremely large extremely rarely. Examples include income, wealth, financial returns, insurance losses, firm size, and city population size; earthquake magnitude, hurricane energy, tornado outbreaks, precipitation, and flooding; and pest outbreaks, infectious epidemics, and forest fires. When such a quantity is modeled as a nonnegative random variable with a heavy upper tail, the probability of an observation larger than some threshold falls as a small power (the {\textquotedblleft}tail index{\textquotedblright}) of the threshold. When the tail index is small enough, the mean and all higher moments of the random quantity are infinite. Surprisingly, the sample mean and the sample higher moments obey orderly scaling laws, which we prove and apply to estimating the tail index.We generalize Taylor{\textquoteright}s law for the variance of light-tailed distributions to many sample statistics of heavy-tailed distributions with tail index α in (0, 1), which have infinite mean. We show that, as the sample size increases, the sample upper and lower semivariances, the sample higher moments, the skewness, and the kurtosis of a random sample from such a law increase asymptotically in direct proportion to a power of the sample mean. Specifically, the lower sample semivariance asymptotically scales in proportion to the sample mean raised to the power 2, while the upper sample semivariance asymptotically scales in proportion to the sample mean raised to the power (2-α)/(1-α)\&gt;2. The local upper sample semivariance (counting only observations that exceed the sample mean) asymptotically scales in proportion to the sample mean raised to the power (2-α2)/(1-α). These and additional scaling laws characterize the asymptotic behavior of commonly used measures of the risk-adjusted performance of investments, such as the Sortino ratio, the Sharpe ratio, the Omega index, the upside potential ratio, and the Farinelli{\textendash}Tibiletti ratio, when returns follow a heavy-tailed nonnegative distribution. Such power-law scaling relationships are known in ecology as Taylor{\textquoteright}s law and in physics as fluctuation scaling. We find the asymptotic distribution and moments of the number of observations exceeding the sample mean. We propose estimators of α based on these scaling laws and the number of observations exceeding the sample mean and compare these estimators with some prior estimators of α.Computer code has been deposited in GitHub (https://github.com/cftang9/TLHM).

However, no general theory can exactly anticipate whether this law provides a valid model for genuine, that is, nonfraudulent, empirical observations, whose generating process cannot be known with certainty. Our first aim is then to establish conditions for the validity of the Newcomb{\textendash}Benford law in the field of international trade data, where frauds typically involve huge amounts of money and constitute a major threat for national budgets. We also provide approximations to the distribution of test statistics when the Newcomb{\textendash}Benford law does not hold, thus opening the door to the development of statistical procedures with good inferential properties and wide applicability.The contrast of fraud in international trade is a crucial task of modern economic regulations. We develop statistical tools for the detection of frauds in customs declarations that rely on the Newcomb{\textendash}Benford law for significant digits. Our first contribution is to show the features, in the context of a European Union market, of the traders for which the law should hold in the absence of fraudulent data manipulation. Our results shed light on a relevant and debated question, since no general known theory can exactly predict validity of the law for genuine empirical data. We also provide approximations to the distribution of test statistics when the Newcomb{\textendash}Benford law does not hold. These approximations open the door to the development of modified goodness-of-fit procedures with wide applicability and good inferential properties.},
