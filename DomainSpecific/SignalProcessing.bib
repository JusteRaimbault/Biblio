	abstract = {Due to the Heisenberg--Gabor uncertainty principle, finite oscillation transients are difficult to localize simultaneously in both time and frequency. Classical estimators, like the short-time Fourier transform or the continuous-wavelet transform optimize either temporal or frequency resolution, or find a suboptimal tradeoff. Here, we introduce a spectral estimator enabling time-frequency super-resolution, called superlet, that uses sets of wavelets with increasingly constrained bandwidth. These are combined geometrically in order to maintain the good temporal resolution of single wavelets and gain frequency resolution in upper bands. The normalization of wavelets in the set facilitates exploration of data with scale-free, fractal nature, containing oscillation packets that are self-similar across frequencies. Superlets perform well on synthetic data and brain signals recorded in humans and rodents, resolving high frequency bursts with excellent precision. Importantly, they can reveal fast transient oscillation events in single trials that may be hidden in the averaged time-frequency spectrum by other methods.},

	abstract = {Multiscale structure is all around us: in biological tissues, active matter, oceans, networks, and images. Identifying the multiscale features of these systems is crucial to our understanding and control of them. We introduce a method that rationally extracts localized multiscale features from data, which may be thought of as the building blocks of the underlying phenomena.Many materials, processes, and structures in science and engineering have important features at multiple scales of time and/or space; examples include biological tissues, active matter, oceans, networks, and images. Explicitly extracting, describing, and defining such features are difficult tasks, at least in part because each system has a unique set of features. Here, we introduce an analysis method that, given a set of observations, discovers an energetic hierarchy of structures localized in scale and space. We call the resulting basis vectors a {\textquotedblleft}data-driven wavelet decomposition.{\textquotedblright} We show that this decomposition reflects the inherent structure of the dataset it acts on, whether it has no structure, structure dominated by a single scale, or structure on a hierarchy of scales. In particular, when applied to turbulence{\textemdash}a high-dimensional, nonlinear, multiscale process{\textemdash}the method reveals self-similar structure over a wide range of spatial scales, providing direct, model-free evidence for a century-old phenomenological picture of turbulence. This approach is a starting point for the characterization of localized hierarchical structures in multiscale systems, which we may think of as the building blocks of these systems.Simulation data and code have been deposited in GitHub, available at https://github.com/dfloryan/DDWD.},
