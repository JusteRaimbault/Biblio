abstract="We investigate Bitcoin network observing transactions broadcasted into the network during a week from 04/05/2016 and then monitoring their inclusion into the blockchain during the following seven months.We unveil that 42{\%} of the transactions are still not included in the Blockchain after 1 h from their appearance and 20{\%} of the transactions are still not included in the Blockchain after 30 days, therefore revealing a great inefficiency in the Bitcoin system. However, we observe that most of these ``forgotten'' transactions have low values and in terms of transferred value the system is less inefficient with 93{\%} of the transactions value being included into the Blockchain within 3 h and 98.8{\%} within a day. The fact that a sizeable fraction of transactions is not processed timely casts serious doubts on the usability of the Bitcoin Blockchain for reliable time-stamping purposes. It also calls for a debate about the right systems of incentives which a peer-to-peer unintermediated system should introduce to promote efficient transaction recording",
