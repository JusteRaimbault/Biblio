	abstract = {The pneumococcus, a bacterium frequently carried in the nasopharynx, is responsible for a wide spectrum of infections in humans, including severe invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs). In nontropical climates, IPDs typically display a marked winter seasonality, a striking but still enigmatic aspect of pneumococcal epidemiology. Here we used dynamic models of carriage transmission and disease, confronted with detailed IPD incidence data, to elucidate the components and the mechanisms underlying the seasonality of IPDs. We find that temporal variations in climate, influenza-like illnesses, and interindividual contacts explain most of the seasonal variability in IPDs. We quantify the potential impact of seasonally timed interventions, a type of control measures that exploit pneumococcal seasonality to help reduce IPDs.Infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae{\textemdash}including invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs){\textemdash}remain a significant public health concern worldwide. The marked winter seasonality of IPDs is a striking, but still enigmatic aspect of pneumococcal epidemiology in nontropical climates. Here we confronted age-structured dynamic models of carriage transmission and disease with detailed IPD incidence data to test a range of hypotheses about the components and the mechanisms of pneumococcal seasonality. We find that seasonal variations in climate, influenza-like illnesses, and interindividual contacts jointly explain IPD seasonality. We show that both the carriage acquisition rate and the invasion rate vary seasonally, acting in concert to generate the marked seasonality typical of IPDs. We also find evidence that influenza-like illnesses increase the invasion rate in an age-specific manner, with a more pronounced effect in the elderly than in other demographics. Finally, we quantify the potential impact of seasonally timed interventions, a type of control measures that exploit pneumococcal seasonality to help reduce IPDs. Our findings shed light on the epidemiology of pneumococcus and may have notable implications for the control of pneumococcal infections.},

	abstract = {Threats from emerging and reemerging infectious diseases have increased globally. However, neglected tropical diseases, such as Chagas disease and schistosomiasis, are believed to attract low attention. We investigated which infectious diseases have been neglected by researchers and which have received attention through an analysis of disease burden and research activity. We found, for example, that influenza and HIV/AIDS have attracted high research attention in relation to their disease burden, while paratyphoid fever has attracted low attention considering the disease burden. Interestingly, not all so-called neglected tropical diseases were subject to low research intensity. Further discussion must occur with regard to the appropriate allocation of resources for research into infectious diseases.Infectious diseases are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although human, financial, substantial, and time resources are limited, it is unknown whether such resources are used effectively in research to manage diseases. The correlation between the disability-adjusted life years to represent disease burden and number of publications as a surrogate for research activity was investigated to measure burden-adjusted research intensity for 52 infectious diseases at global and country levels. There was significantly low research intensity for paratyphoid fever and high intensity for influenza, HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis considering their disease burden. We identified the infectious diseases that have received the most attention from researchers and those that have been relatively disregarded. Interestingly, not all so-called neglected tropical diseases were subject to low burden-adjusted research intensity. Analysis of the intensity of infectious disease research at a country level revealed characteristic patterns. These findings provided a basis for further discussion of the more appropriate allocation of resources for research into infectious diseases.},

	abstract = {This study infers probabilistic infection routes of a vector-borne disease, by modeling internal dynamics of metapopulations driven by human mobility as multivariate stochastic processes. In this way, our proposed model uncovers the self-excitation and mutual excitation nature of disease spread across a heterogeneous social system with rich context. Our model is a general extension of networked Hawkes processes, providing flexibilities to add constraints (presence of diffusion medium) and to use domain knowledge (cross-metapopulation connectivity), enabling covering of direct and indirect diffusion processes such as contact-based and vector-borne disease spread. Our model is readily applicable to a wide range of intragroup and intergroup diffusion processes in social and natural systems and can infer probabilistic causality between discrete events.Diffusion processes are governed by external triggers and internal dynamics in complex systems. Timely and cost-effective control of infectious disease spread critically relies on uncovering underlying diffusion mechanisms, which is challenging due to invisible infection pathways and time-evolving intensity of infection cases. Here, we propose a new diffusion framework for stochastic processes, which models disease spread across metapopulations by incorporating human mobility as topological pathways in a heterogeneous social system. We apply Bayesian inference with the stochastic Expectation{\textendash}Maximization algorithm to quantify underlying diffusion dynamics in terms of exogeneity and endogeneity and estimate cross-regional infection flow based on Granger causality. The effectiveness of our proposed model is shown by using comprehensive simulation procedures (robustness tests with noisy data considering missing or delayed human case reporting in real situations) and by applying the model to real data from 15-y dengue outbreaks in Australia.},

  abstract = {New epidemics of infectious diseases can emerge any time, as illustrated by the emergence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in Latin America. During new epidemics, public health officials face difficult decisions regarding spatial targeting of interventions to optimally allocate limited resources. We used a large-scale, data-driven, agent-based simulation model (ABM) to explore CHIKV mitigation strategies, including strategies based on previous DENV outbreaks. Our model represents CHIKV transmission in a realistic population of Colombia with 45 million individuals in 10.6 million households, schools, and workplaces. Our model uses high-resolution probability maps for the occurrence of the Ae. aegypti mosquito vector to estimate mosquito density in Colombia. We found that vector control in all 521 municipalities with mosquito populations led to 402,940 fewer clinical cases of CHIKV compared to a baseline scenario without intervention. We also explored using data about previous dengue virus (DENV) epidemics to inform CHIKV mitigation strategies. Compared to the baseline scenario, 314,437 fewer cases occurred when we simulated vector control only in 301 municipalities that had previously reported DENV, illustrating the value of available data from previous outbreaks. When varying the implementation parameters for vector control, we found that faster implementation and scale-up of vector control led to the greatest proportionate reduction in cases. Using available data for epidemic simulations can strengthen decision making against new epidemic threats.},

	abstract = {Infection with multiple parasite species is common and the majority of coinfections involve at least one long-lasting infection. Our data-driven model of chronic coinfection dynamics shows that accurate prediction at the population level requires quantifying both the individual-level transmission and mortality consequences of coinfection. The infections characterized in this study compete at the population level. When one pathogen facilitates both the transmission and progression of the second pathogen, the prevalence of the first pathogen is reduced. This mechanism of competition is unique compared with previously described mechanisms and occurs without cross-immunity, resource competition within the host, or convalescence. We recommend assessing the generality of this mechanism, which could have important consequences for other chronic, immunosuppressive pathogens such as HIV or TB.Coinfecting parasites and pathogens remain a leading challenge for global public health due to their consequences for individual-level infection risk and disease progression. However, a clear understanding of the population-level consequences of coinfection is lacking. Here, we constructed a model that includes three individual-level effects of coinfection: mortality, fecundity, and transmission. We used the model to investigate how these individual-level consequences of coinfection scale up to produce population-level infection patterns. To parameterize this model, we conducted a 4-y cohort study in African buffalo to estimate the individual-level effects of coinfection with two bacterial pathogens, bovine tuberculosis (bTB) and brucellosis, across a range of demographic and environmental contexts. At the individual level, our empirical results identified bTB as a risk factor for acquiring brucellosis, but we found no association between brucellosis and the risk of acquiring bTB. Both infections were associated with reductions in survival and neither infection was associated with reductions in fecundity. The model reproduced coinfection patterns in the data and predicted opposite impacts of coinfection at individual and population scales: Whereas bTB facilitated brucellosis infection at the individual level, our model predicted the presence of brucellosis to have a strong negative impact on bTB at the population level. In modeled populations where brucellosis was present, the endemic prevalence and basic reproduction number (R0) of bTB were lower than in populations without brucellosis. Therefore, these results provide a data-driven example of competition between coinfecting pathogens that occurs when one pathogen facilitates secondary infections at the individual level.},
