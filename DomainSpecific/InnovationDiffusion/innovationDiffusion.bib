	abstract = {Measuring the value of intangibles is not easy, because they are critical but usually invisible components of the innovation process. Today, access to nonsurvey data sources, such as administrative data and repositories captured on web pages, opens opportunities to create intangibles based on new sources of information and capture intangible innovations in new ways. Intangibles include ownership of innovative property and human resources that make a company unique but are currently unmeasured. For example, intangibles represent the value of a company{\textquoteright}s databases and software, the tacit knowledge of their workers, and the investments in research and development (R\&amp;D) and design. Through two case studies, the challenges and processes to both create and measure intangibles are presented using a data science framework that outlines processes to discover, acquire, profile, clean, link, explore the fitness-for-use, and statistically analyze the data. The first case study shows that creating organizational innovation is possible by linking administrative data across business processes in a Fortune 500 company. The motivation for this research is to develop company processes capable of synchronizing their supply chain end to end while capturing dynamics that can alter the inventory, profits, and service balance. The second example shows the feasibility of measurement of innovation related to the characteristics of open source software through data scraped from software repositories that provide this information. The ultimate goal is to develop accurate and repeatable measures to estimate the value of nonbusiness sector open source software to the economy. This early work shows the feasibility of these approaches.},

abstract="Since its introduction in the 1960s, the theory of innovation diffusion has contributed to the advancement of several research fields, such as marketing management and consumer behavior. The 1969 seminal paper by Bass [F.M. Bass, Manag. Sci. 15, 215 (1969)] introduced a model of product growth for consumer durables, which has been extensively used to predict innovation diffusion across a range of applications. Here, we propose a novel approach to study innovation diffusion, where interactions among individuals are mediated by the dynamics of a time-varying network. Our approach is based on the Bass' model, and overcomes key limitations of previous studies, which assumed timescale separation between the individual dynamics and the evolution of the connectivity patterns. Thus, we do not hypothesize homogeneous mixing among individuals or the existence of a fixed interaction network. We formulate our approach in the framework of activity driven networks to enable the analysis of the concurrent evolution of the interaction and individual dynamics. Numerical simulations offer a systematic analysis of the model behavior and highlight the role of individual activity on market penetration when targeted advertisement campaigns are designed, or a competition between two different products takes place.",
