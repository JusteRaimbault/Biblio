	abstract = {Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a psychedelic drug that reliably induces an altered state of consciousness. Interest in psychedelic compounds is growing due to their remarkable potential for understanding altered neural states and potential clinical applications. However, there are major knowledge gaps regarding LSD{\textquoteright}s neuropharmacology. Using cutting-edge neuroimaging methods we investigated directed connectivity between cortico{\textendash}striato{\textendash}thalamo-cortical (CSTC) regions after administration of LSD together with the specific role of the serotonin 2A receptor. Our results provide evidence that LSD alters directed connectivity within CSTC pathways in humans, suggesting that a disintegration of information processing within these loops is underlying the psychedelic state. These results inform the neurobiology of altered states of consciousness with critical implications for rational development of novel treatments.Psychedelics exert unique effects on human consciousness. The thalamic filter model suggests that core effects of psychedelics may result from gating deficits, based on a disintegration of information processing within cortico{\textendash}striato{\textendash}thalamo-cortical (CSTC) feedback loops. To test this hypothesis, we characterized changes in directed (effective) connectivity between selected CTSC regions after acute administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and after pretreatment with Ketanserin (a selective serotonin 2A receptor antagonist) plus LSD in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in 25 healthy participants. We used spectral dynamic causal modeling (DCM) for resting-state fMRI data. Fully connected DCM models were specified for each treatment condition to investigate the connectivity between the following areas: thalamus, ventral striatum, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporal cortex. Our results confirm major predictions proposed in the CSTC model and provide evidence that LSD alters effective connectivity within CSTC pathways that have been implicated in the gating of sensory and sensorimotor information to the cortex. In particular, LSD increased effective connectivity from the thalamus to the posterior cingulate cortex in a way that depended on serotonin 2A receptor activation, and decreased effective connectivity from the ventral striatum to the thalamus independently of serotonin 2A receptor activation. Together, these results advance our mechanistic understanding of the action of psychedelics in health and disease. This is important for the development of new pharmacological therapeutics and also increases our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the potential clinical efficacy of psychedelics.},

	abstract = {While several features of brain activity can be used to predict the variability of painful percepts within a given individual, it is much more difficult to predict pain variability across individuals. Here, we used electrophysiology to sample brain activity of humans and rodents, and demonstrated that laser-induced gamma oscillations sampled by central electrodes predict pain sensitivity across individuals both reliably and selectively: reliably, because they consistently predict between-subject pain intensity in both humans and rodents; selectively, because they do not track the between-subject reported intensity of nonpainful but equally salient auditory, visual, and nonnociceptive somatosensory stimuli. This discovery indicates that variability in an individual{\textquoteright}s pain sensitivity is, at least partly, explained by variability in the amplitude of gamma oscillations of that individual.Individuals exhibit considerable and unpredictable variability in painful percepts in response to the same nociceptive stimulus. Previous work has found neural responses that, while not necessarily responsible for the painful percepts themselves, can still correlate well with intensity of pain perception within a given individual. However, there is no reliable neural response reflecting the variability in pain perception across individuals. Here, we use an electrophysiological approach in humans and rodents to demonstrate that brain oscillations in the gamma band [gamma-band event-related synchronization (γ-ERS)] sampled by central electrodes reliably predict pain sensitivity across individuals. We observed a clear dissociation between the large number of neural measures that reflected subjective pain ratings at within-subject level but not across individuals, and γ-ERS, which reliably distinguished subjective ratings within the same individual but also coded pain sensitivity across different individuals. Importantly, the ability of γ-ERS to track pain sensitivity across individuals was selective because it did not track the between-subject reported intensity of nonpainful but equally salient auditory, visual, and nonnociceptive somatosensory stimuli. These results also demonstrate that graded neural activity related to within-subject variability should be minimized to accurately investigate the relationship between nociceptive-evoked neural activities and pain sensitivity across individuals.},

	abstract = {Social decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning, and can be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The Prisoner{\textquoteright}s Dilemma (PD) is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly characterised, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent behaviour unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating how the serotonergic enhancer MDMA modulates behaviour and its neural correlates during an iterated PD with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents.We administered 100mg MDMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned, participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in levels of cooperation. On each round participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player.Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: OR=2.01 95\% CI 1.42--2.84, p\&lt;0.001; OR=1.37 95\% CI 0.78--2.30 n.s.). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment-by-opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions.MDMA increased cooperative behaviour when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA{\textquoteright}s effect on social decision-making.Significance statementWe provide a detailed analysis of the effect of MDMA on cooperative behaviour during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behaviour have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared to placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behaviour are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents{\textquoteright} behaviour in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasising the important role of the behaviour of others towards us.},

	abstract = {Winged insects perform remarkable aerial feats in uncertain, complex fluid environments. This ability is enabled by sensation of mechanical forces to inform rapid corrections in body orientation. Curiously, mechanoreceptor neurons do not faithfully report forces; instead, they are activated by specific time histories of forcing. We find that, far from being a bug, neural encoding by biological sensors is a feature that acts as built-in temporal filtering superbly matched to detect body rotation. Indeed, this encoding further enables surprisingly efficient detection using only a small handful of neurons at key locations. Nature suggests smart data as an alternative strategy to big data, and neural-inspired sensors establish a paradigm in hyperefficient sensing of complex systems.Sparse sensor placement is a central challenge in the efficient characterization of complex systems when the cost of acquiring and processing data is high. Leading sparse sensing methods typically exploit either spatial or temporal correlations, but rarely both. This work introduces a sparse sensor optimization that is designed to leverage the rich spatiotemporal coherence exhibited by many systems. Our approach is inspired by the remarkable performance of flying insects, which use a few embedded strain-sensitive neurons to achieve rapid and robust flight control despite large gust disturbances. Specifically, we identify neural-inspired sensors at a few key locations on a flapping wing that are able to detect body rotation. This task is particularly challenging as the rotational twisting mode is three orders of magnitude smaller than the flapping modes. We show that nonlinear filtering in time, built to mimic strain-sensitive neurons, is essential to detect rotation, whereas instantaneous measurements fail. Optimized sparse sensor placement results in efficient classification with approximately 10 sensors, achieving the same accuracy and noise robustness as full measurements consisting of hundreds of sensors. Sparse sensing with neural-inspired encoding establishes an alternative paradigm in hyperefficient, embodied sensing of spatiotemporal data and sheds light on principles of biological sensing for agile flight control.},

	abstract = {One of the biggest computational challenges the memory system faces is to disambiguate highly similar experiences while at the same time preserving and reinstating prior memories. Remarkably, hippocampal processes have been implicated in both of these functions. However, how this is accomplished is unknown. Leveraging the spatiotemporal resolution of electrocorticography, we found evidence for memory reinstatement in both the hippocampus and occipitotemporal cortex. Interestingly, when a current experience was very similar but not identical to a prior one, occipitotemporal cortical activity still showed reinstatement of the prior memory, but hippocampal activity differentiated or disambiguated these two similar experiences.Mnemonic decision-making has long been hypothesized to rely on hippocampal dynamics that bias memory processing toward the formation of new memories or the retrieval of old ones. Successful memory encoding may be best optimized by pattern separation, whereby two highly similar experiences can be represented by underlying neural populations in an orthogonal manner. By contrast, successful memory retrieval is thought to be supported by a recovery of the same neural pattern laid down during encoding. Here we examined how hippocampal pattern completion and separation emerge over time during memory decisions. We measured electrocorticography activity in the human hippocampus and posterior occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) while participants performed continuous recognition of items that were new, repeated (old), or highly similar to a prior item (similar). During retrieval decisions of old items, both regions exhibited significant reinstatement of multivariate high-frequency activity (HFA) associated with encoding. Further, the extent of reinstatement of encoding patterns during retrieval was correlated with the strength (HFA power) of hippocampal encoding. Evidence for encoding pattern reinstatement was also seen in OTC on trials requiring fine-grained discrimination of similar items. By contrast, hippocampal activity showed evidence for pattern separation during these trials. Together, these results underscore the critical role of the hippocampus in supporting both reinstatement of overlapping information and separation of similar events.},

	abstract = {Humans and animals are capable of rapid learning from a small dataset, which is still difficult for artificial neural networks. Recent studies further suggest that our learning speed is nearly optimal given a stream of information, but its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we hypothesized that the elaborate connection structure between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites is the key element for this near-optimal learning and derived a data-efficient rule for dendritic synaptic plasticity and rewiring from Bayesian theory. We implemented this rule in a detailed neuron model of visual perceptual learning and found that the model well reproduces various known properties of dendritic plasticity and synaptic organization in cortical neurons.Recent experimental studies suggest that, in cortical microcircuits of the mammalian brain, the majority of neuron-to-neuron connections are realized by multiple synapses. However, it is not known whether such redundant synaptic connections provide any functional benefit. Here, we show that redundant synaptic connections enable near-optimal learning in cooperation with synaptic rewiring. By constructing a simple dendritic neuron model, we demonstrate that with multisynaptic connections synaptic plasticity approximates a sample-based Bayesian filtering algorithm known as particle filtering, and wiring plasticity implements its resampling process. Extending the proposed framework to a detailed single-neuron model of perceptual learning in the primary visual cortex, we show that the model accounts for many experimental observations. In particular, the proposed model reproduces the dendritic position dependence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity and the functional synaptic organization on the dendritic tree based on the stimulus selectivity of presynaptic neurons. Our study provides a conceptual framework for synaptic plasticity and rewiring.},

										abstract = {Probing functional interactions among the nodes in a network is crucial to understanding how complex systems work. Existing methodologies widely assume static network structures or Gaussian statistics or do not take account of likely sparse interactions. They are therefore not well-suited to neuronal spiking data with rapid task-dependent dynamics, binary statistics, and sparse functional dependencies. We develop an inference framework for extracting functional network dynamics from neuronal data by integrating techniques from adaptive filtering, compressed sensing, point processes, and high-dimensional statistics. We derive efficient estimation algorithms and precise statistical inference procedures. We apply our proposed techniques to experimentally recorded neuronal data to probe the neuronal functional networks underlying attentive behavior. Our techniques provide substantial gains in computation, resolution, and statistical robustness.Quantifying the functional relations between the nodes in a network based on local observations is a key challenge in studying complex systems. Most existing time series analysis techniques for this purpose provide static estimates of the network properties, pertain to stationary Gaussian data, or do not take into account the ubiquitous sparsity in the underlying functional networks. When applied to spike recordings from neuronal ensembles undergoing rapid task-dependent dynamics, they thus hinder a precise statistical characterization of the dynamic neuronal functional networks underlying adaptive behavior. We develop a dynamic estimation and inference paradigm for extracting functional neuronal network dynamics in the sense of Granger, by integrating techniques from adaptive filtering, compressed sensing, point process theory, and high-dimensional statistics. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed paradigm through theoretical analysis, algorithm development, and application to synthetic and real data. Application of our techniques to two-photon Ca2+ imaging experiments from the mouse auditory cortex reveals unique features of the functional neuronal network structures underlying spontaneous activity at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Our analysis of simultaneous recordings from the ferret auditory and prefrontal cortical areas suggests evidence for the role of rapid top-down and bottom-up functional dynamics across these areas involved in robust attentive behavior.},
