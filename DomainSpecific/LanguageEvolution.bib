	abstract = {Color names in human languages are organized into efficient systems optimizing an accuracy/complexity trade-off. We show that artificial neural networks trained with generic deep-learning methods to play a color-discrimination game develop color-naming systems whose distribution on the accuracy/complexity plane is strikingly similar to that of human languages. We proceed to show that efficiency and narrow complexity crucially depend on the discrete nature of communication, acting as an information bottleneck on the emergent code. This suggests that efficient categorization of colors (and possibly other semantic domains) in natural languages does not depend on specific biological constraints of humans, but it is instead a general property of discrete communication systems.Words categorize the semantic fields they refer to in ways that maximize communication accuracy while minimizing complexity. Focusing on the well-studied color domain, we show that artificial neural networks trained with deep-learning techniques to play a discrimination game develop communication systems whose distribution on the accuracy/complexity plane closely matches that of human languages. The observed variation among emergent color-naming systems is explained by different degrees of discriminative need, of the sort that might also characterize different human communities. Like human languages, emergent systems show a preference for relatively low-complexity solutions, even at the cost of imperfect communication. We demonstrate next that the nature of the emergent systems crucially depends on communication being discrete (as is human word usage). When continuous message passing is allowed, emergent systems become more complex and eventually less efficient. Our study suggests that efficient semantic categorization is a general property of discrete communication systems, not limited to human language. It suggests moreover that it is exactly the discrete nature of such systems that, acting as a bottleneck, pushes them toward low complexity and optimal efficiency.The models reported in this paper have been deposited in GitHub (https://github.com/rahmacha/EGG).March 16, 2021: The license for this article has been updated.},

	abstract = {Human languages share many grammatical properties. We show that some of these properties can be explained by the need for languages to offer efficient communication between humans given our cognitive constraints. Grammars of languages seem to find a balance between two communicative pressures: to be simple enough to allow the speaker to easily produce sentences, but complex enough to be unambiguous to the hearer, and this balance explains well-known word-order generalizations across our sample of 51 varied languages. Our results offer quantitative and computational evidence that language structure is dynamically shaped by communicative and cognitive pressures.The universal properties of human languages have been the subject of intense study across the language sciences. We report computational and corpus evidence for the hypothesis that a prominent subset of these universal properties{\textemdash}those related to word order{\textemdash}result from a process of optimization for efficient communication among humans, trading off the need to reduce complexity with the need to reduce ambiguity. We formalize these two pressures with information-theoretic and neural-network models of complexity and ambiguity and simulate grammars with optimized word-order parameters on large-scale data from 51 languages. Evolution of grammars toward efficiency results in word-order patterns that predict a large subset of the major word-order correlations across languages.},

	abstract = {Social conventions, such as shaking hands or dressing formally, allow us to coordinate smoothly and, once established, appear to be natural. But what happens when a new convention replaces an old one? This question has remained largely unanswered so far, due to the lack of suitable data. Here, we investigate the process of norm change by looking at 2,541 linguistic norm shifts occurring over the last two centuries in English and Spanish. We identify different patterns of norm adoption depending on whether the change is spontaneous or driven by a centralized institution, and we propose a simple model that reproduces all of the empirical observations. These results shed light on the cultural evolution of linguistic norms and human collective behavior.What happens when a new social convention replaces an old one? While the possible forces favoring norm change{\textemdash}such as institutions or committed activists{\textemdash}have been identified for a long time, little is known about how a population adopts a new convention, due to the difficulties of finding representative data. Here, we address this issue by looking at changes that occurred to 2,541 orthographic and lexical norms in English and Spanish through the analysis of a large corpora of books published between the years 1800 and 2008. We detect three markedly distinct patterns in the data, depending on whether the behavioral change results from the action of a formal institution, an informal authority, or a spontaneous process of unregulated evolution. We propose a simple evolutionary model able to capture all of the observed behaviors, and we show that it reproduces quantitatively the empirical data. This work identifies general mechanisms of norm change, and we anticipate that it will be of interest to researchers investigating the cultural evolution of language and, more broadly, human collective behavior.},

	abstract = {Speakers of a language somehow come to use the same words to express particular meanings{\textemdash}like {\textquotedblleft}dog{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}table{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}even though there is seldom a necessary connection between a word and its meaning, and there are often many alternatives from which to choose (e.g., {\textquotedblleft}sofa,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}couch,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}settee{\textquotedblright}). We show that word choice is not just a matter of saying what others say. Rather, humans seem to be equipped with a bias that makes them disproportionately more likely to use the words that most others use. The force of this bias can drive competing words out, allowing a single word to dominate all others. It can also explain how languages spontaneously organize and remain relatively stable for centuries or even millennia.A puzzle of language is how speakers come to use the same words for particular meanings, given that there are often many competing alternatives (e.g., {\textquotedblleft}sofa,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}couch,{\textquotedblright} {\textquotedblleft}settee{\textquotedblright}), and there is seldom a necessary connection between a word and its meaning. The well-known process of random drift{\textemdash}roughly corresponding in this context to {\textquotedblleft}say what you hear{\textquotedblright}{\textemdash}can cause the frequencies of alternative words to fluctuate over time, and it is even possible for one of the words to replace all others, without any form of selection being involved. However, is drift alone an adequate explanation of a shared vocabulary? Darwin thought not. Here, we apply models of neutral drift, directional selection, and positive frequency-dependent selection to explain over 417,000 word-use choices for 418 meanings in two natural populations of speakers. We find that neutral drift does not in general explain word use. Instead, some form of selection governs word choice in over 91\% of the meanings we studied. In cases where one word dominates all others for a particular meaning{\textemdash}such as is typical of the words in the core lexicon of a language{\textemdash}word choice is guided by positive frequency-dependent selection{\textemdash}a bias that makes speakers disproportionately likely to use the words that most others use. This bias grants an increasing advantage to the common form as it becomes more popular and provides a mechanism to explain how a shared vocabulary can spontaneously self-organize and then be maintained for centuries or even millennia, despite new words continually entering the lexicon.},
