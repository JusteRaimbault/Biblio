abstract="In this paper, we propose a road evolution model by considering the interaction between population distribution and urban road network. In the model, new roads need to be constructed when new zones are built, and existing zones with higher population density have higher probability to connect with new roads. The relative neighborhood graph and a Fermat-Weber location problem are introduced as the connection mechanism to capture the characteristics of road evolution. The simulation experiment is conducted to demonstrate the effects of population on road evolution. Moreover, the topological attributes for the urban road network are evaluated using degree distribution, betweenness centrality, coverage, circuitness and treeness in the experiment. Simulation results show that the distribution of population in the city has a significant influence on the shape of road network, leading to a growing heterogeneous topology.",

Here we analyze the topological patterns of organization of a large collection of such settlements using the approach of complex networks. The global efficiency (based on the inverse of shortest-path lengths), robustness to disconnections and cost (in terms of length) of these graphs is studied and their possible origins analyzed. A wide range of patterns is found, from tree-like settlements (highly vulnerable to random failures) to meshed urban patterns. The latter are shown to be more robust and efficient. ",

This paper proposes to extend the analysis to the case in which esthetic and variety, rather than orientation, are the key elements of street selection. It is widely recognized that most people are attracted to curvy paths rather than straight ones; therefore, when one is not worried about losing orientation in her walk, or when the preferred path is well recognizable even when it requires changes of direction, we should adopt another criterion to weigh distances: morphoahestetic and networkvariety criteria are shown as potential parameterization for Space Syntax distances. },

journal="Networks and Spatial Economics",
year="2019",
month="Mar",
day="23",
abstract="Advanced producer service (APS) firms play key roles in the initial public offerings (IPOs) of firms in stock markets. Based on interfirm service relationships between APS firms and their clients in the IPOs of Chinese firms in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) in the period 1999--2017, this study explores how world city networks are shaped in the global financing activities of Chinese firms. The results show that very widely distributed cities are involved in the networks and that Hong Kong holds an overwhelmingly dominant position. In addition, London and the Cayman Islands have become key overseas nodes by providing significant services for Chinese firms, but most overseas cities mainly provide legal services. Furthermore, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen are in pioneering positions in developing connections with both world cities and offshore jurisdictions. Beijing has great advantages over all other Mainland China cities because it has become both the command center and a service provider. Compared to Hong Kong, Mainland China cities still hold very marginal positions as service providers. Global financing activities by firms from emerging economies such as China have the potential to reshape the world city networks and might have important impacts on the evolution of international and domestic financial center networks. The results indicate that this is a feasible way to explore the relationships between commanding centers and APS centers based on service linkages in the IPO process from the perspective of the world city network. This study also sheds light on the future quantitative analysis of global financial networks.",

abstract="Cities play an important role in the regional, national and continental development of economies, as well as global trade and infrastructure. Most of this development revolves around the presence of multinational firms and the inter-connected systems formed by their linkages. Analyzing the networks formed by these multinational firms can uncover many interesting trends and patterns providing insight into not only the development of individual cities, but also the various world regions they belong to. In this paper, we are particularly interested in networks of cities from the year 2010 and 2013 in order to understand how cities have changed in the context of networks of multinational firms. We consider diversity, strength and centrality as the key indicators to measure the importance of a city and based on these indicators analyze how cities have changed their roles in the networks of multinational firms overtime. We also introduce a cumulative ranking based on these three indicators to position cities in terms of their importance in the world. This study not only strengthens previous findings from a network analysis perspective but it also reveals the cities with considerable growth and/or significant decline over the periods studied.",

journal="Networks and Spatial Economics",

month="Nov",
day="07",
abstract="Over the last fifty years, research into street networks has gained prominence with a rapidly growing number of studies across disparate disciplines. These studies investigate a wide range of phenomena using a wealth of data and diverse analytical techniques. Starting within the fields of transport or infrastructure engineering, street networks have commonly been treated as sets of more or less homogeneous linear elements, connecting locations and intersecting at junctions. This view is commonly represented as a graph, which provides a common and rigorous formalisation accessible across disciplines and is particularly well-suited for problems such as flow optimisation and routing. Street networks are, however, complex objects of investigation and the way we model and then represent them as graphs has fundamental effects on the outcomes of a study. Many approaches to modelling street networks have been proposed, each lending itself to different analyses and supporting insights into diverse aspects of the urban system. Yet, this plurality and the relation between different models remains relatively obscure and unexplored. The motivations for adopting a given model of the network are also not always clear and often seem to follow disciplinary traditions. This paper provides an overview of key street network models and the prima facie merits of pertinent alternative approaches. It suggests greater attention to consistent use of terms and concepts, of graph representations and practical applications, and concludes with suggestions for possible ways forward.",
