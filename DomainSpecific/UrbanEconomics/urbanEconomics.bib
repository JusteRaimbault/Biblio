abstract="The organization of modern economies is built upon an efficient transport system and an increasing role is played by the logistics sector in overcoming the constraints of time and distance in modern supply chains. While a large body of literature is dedicated to the spatial distribution of firms and firm location choice in general, surprisingly little is still known about the location patterns of logistics firms, and more specifically about the role of accessibility in their location decisions. We use geo-referenced firm level data along with detailed information on transport infrastructure in order to investigate the geography of logistics firms in Spain. We place specific attention to the relationship between logistics firm location, accessibility, and urban structure. Our results show that these firms are located closer to highways and other transport infrastructure compared to other sectors and that the logistics sector is highly urbanized. Yet, they are also locating increasingly in suburban locations and to some extent in extra-urban locations with good accessibility while central cities of urban areas have experienced a declining share of logistics firms.",
