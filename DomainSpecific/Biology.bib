abstract="We propose that the onset and progressive destructive action of cancer within an individual bears a profound and striking similarity to the onset and progressive human-engendered destruction of global ecosystems and the extinction of entire species. Cancer in the human body and our human role in planetary, especially biotic, degradation are uncannily similar systems. For starters, they are the only two known complex systems where a discrete component changes its normal ecological role and function---turning on and potentially killing its host, and in so doing, itself. Both are ``hostile takeovers.'' Clearly, humans are integral to both systems. With cancer we are the host and victims of the rogue behavior of what starts out as a normal, healthy, and functionally important part of our bodies. With the biodiversity crisis, we are the part of the system that has changed, expanded, and proven so destructive to the system in which we live. We argue that given that these threats to our bodies and Earth are both essentially ecological diseases, understanding the critical role of ecological interdependencies for avoiding both cancer's and humankind's destruction of their respective homes should hopefully promote better stewardship of both by the only animal capable of recognizing the problems---us.",

The slime mold Physarum polycephalum solves complex problems, for example finding the shortest route between food sources, despite growing as a single cell and the lack of any neural circuitry. By carefully observing P. polycephalum{\textquoteright}s response to a nutrient stimulus and using the data to develop a mathematical model, we identify a simple mechanism underpinning the slime mold{\textquoteright}s behaviors: A stimulus triggers the release of a signaling molecule. The molecule is initially advected by fluid flows but also increases fluid flows, generating a feedback loop and enabling the movement of information throughout the organism{\textquoteright}s body. This simple mechanism is sufficient to explain P. polycephalum{\textquoteright}s emergent, complex behaviors.Complex behaviors are typically associated with animals, but the capacity to integrate information and function as a coordinated individual is also a ubiquitous but poorly understood feature of organisms such as slime molds and fungi. Plasmodial slime molds grow as networks and use flexible, undifferentiated body plans to forage for food. How an individual communicates across its network remains a puzzle, but Physarum polycephalum has emerged as a novel model used to explore emergent dynamics. Within P. polycephalum, cytoplasm is shuttled in a peristaltic wave driven by cross-sectional contractions of tubes. We first track P. polycephalum{\textquoteright}s response to a localized nutrient stimulus and observe a front of increased contraction. The front propagates with a velocity comparable to the flow-driven dispersion of particles. We build a mathematical model based on these data and in the aggregate experiments and model identify the mechanism of signal propagation across a body: The nutrient stimulus triggers the release of a signaling molecule. The molecule is advected by fluid flows but simultaneously hijacks flow generation by causing local increases in contraction amplitude as it travels. The molecule is initiating a feedback loop to enable its own movement. This mechanism explains previously puzzling phenomena, including the adaptation of the peristaltic wave to organism size and P. polycephalum{\textquoteright}s ability to find the shortest route between food sources. A simple feedback seems to give rise to P. polycephalum{\textquoteright}s complex behaviors, and the same mechanism is likely to function in the thousands of additional species with similar behaviors.},

	abstract = {Protein{\textendash}protein interactions are important to all facets of life, but their experimental and computational characterization is arduous and frequently of uncertain outcome. The current study demonstrates both the power and limitation to study protein interactions by utilizing sophisticated statistical inference technology to derive protein contacts from available sequence databases, more precisely from the coevolution between residues, that are in contact across the interaction interface of two proteins. By studying homo-oligomeric protein interactions, the current study expands from anecdotal evidence of the performance of this technology to systematic evidence of its value across close to 2,000 interacting protein families.Proteins have evolved to perform diverse cellular functions, from serving as reaction catalysts to coordinating cellular propagation and development. Frequently, proteins do not exert their full potential as monomers but rather undergo concerted interactions as either homo-oligomers or with other proteins as hetero-oligomers. The experimental study of such protein complexes and interactions has been arduous. Theoretical structure prediction methods are an attractive alternative. Here, we investigate homo-oligomeric interfaces by tracing residue coevolution via the global statistical direct coupling analysis (DCA). DCA can accurately infer spatial adjacencies between residues. These adjacencies can be included as constraints in structure prediction techniques to predict high-resolution models. By taking advantage of the ongoing exponential growth of sequence databases, we go significantly beyond anecdotal cases of a few protein families and apply DCA to a systematic large-scale study of nearly 2,000 Pfam protein families with sufficient sequence information and structurally resolved homo-oligomeric interfaces. We find that large interfaces are commonly identified by DCA. We further demonstrate that DCA can differentiate between subfamilies with different binding modes within one large Pfam family. Sequence-derived contact information for the subfamilies proves sufficient to assemble accurate structural models of the diverse protein-oligomers. Thus, we provide an approach to investigate oligomerization for arbitrary protein families leading to structural models complementary to often-difficult experimental methods. Combined with ever more abundant sequential data, we anticipate that this study will be instrumental to allow the structural description of many heteroprotein complexes in the future.},

abstract = "It has become customary to conceptualize the living cell as an intricate piece of machinery, different to a man-made machine only in terms of its superior complexity. This familiar understanding grounds the conviction that a cell's organization can be explained reductionistically, as well as the idea that its molecular pathways can be construed as deterministic circuits. The machine conception of the cell owes a great deal of its success to the methods traditionally used in molecular biology. However, the recent introduction of novel experimental techniques capable of tracking individual molecules within cells in real time is leading to the rapid accumulation of data that are inconsistent with an engineering view of the cell. This paper examines four major domains of current research in which the challenges to the machine conception of the cell are particularly pronounced: cellular architecture, protein complexes, intracellular transport, and cellular behaviour. It argues that a new theoretical understanding of the cell is emerging from the study of these phenomena which emphasizes the dynamic, self-organizing nature of its constitution, the fluidity and plasticity of its components, and the stochasticity and non-linearity of its underlying processes.",

	abstract = {The Hedgehog-signaling pathway plays key roles in animal development and physiology. Insufficient Hedgehog signaling causes birth defects, whereas uncontrolled signaling is implicated in cancer. Signaling is triggered by the secreted protein, Sonic Hedgehog, which inhibits the membrane protein Patched1, leading to pathway activation. Despite its fundamental importance, we do not understand how Sonic Hedgehog inhibits Patched1. Here, we uncover a critical interaction between the fatty-acid{\textendash}modified N-terminal portion of Sonic Hedgehog and Patched1, and we demonstrate that it is necessary and sufficient for Patched1 inhibition during Hedgehog signaling. This interaction explains impairment of a Sonic Hedgehog mutant causing a congenital brain malformation (holoprosencephaly) and oncogenic activity of Patched1 mutants responsible for a human cancer syndrome.The Hedgehog cell{\textendash}cell signaling pathway is crucial for animal development, and its misregulation is implicated in numerous birth defects and cancers. In unstimulated cells, pathway activity is inhibited by the tumor suppressor membrane protein, Patched. Hedgehog signaling is triggered by the secreted Hedgehog ligand, which binds and inhibits Patched, thus setting in motion the downstream events in signal transduction. Despite its critical importance, the mechanism by which Hedgehog antagonizes Patched has remained unknown. Here, we show that vertebrate Patched1 inhibition is caused by direct, palmitate-dependent interaction with the Sonic Hedgehog ligand. We find that a short palmitoylated N-terminal fragment of Sonic Hedgehog binds Patched1 and, strikingly, is sufficient to inhibit it and to activate signaling. The rest of Sonic Hedgehog confers high-affinity Patched1 binding and internalization through a distinct binding site, but, surprisingly, it is not absolutely required for signaling. The palmitate-dependent interaction with Patched1 is specifically impaired in a Sonic Hedgehog mutant causing human holoprosencephaly, the most frequent congenital brain malformation, explaining its drastically reduced potency. The palmitate-dependent interaction is also abolished in constitutively inhibited Patched1 point mutants causing the Gorlin cancer syndrome, suggesting that they might adopt a conformation distinct from the wild type. Our data demonstrate that Sonic Hedgehog signals via the palmitate-dependent arm of a two-pronged contact with Patched1. Furthermore, our results suggest that, during Hedgehog signaling, ligand binding inhibits Patched by trapping it in an inactive conformation, a mechanism that explains the dramatically reduced activity of oncogenic Patched1 mutants.},

	abstract = {Biomolecular machines implement many vital activities in cells and must operate quickly and in functional directions, requiring energy dissipation. Recent experiments reveal that some evolved machines are quite energetically efficient, engendering interest in design principles that achieve such high efficiency. Recent theory predicts how to use equilibrium measurements (in the absence of driving) to design ways to drive a system to minimize energy dissipation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the utility of this theory for designing efficient driving processes ({\textquotedblleft}protocols{\textquotedblright}) by rapidly unfolding and folding single DNA hairpins. We show that such designed protocols systematically and significantly reduce energy dissipation over large variations of driving speed and DNA hairpin friction. Similar protocols may underlie the high efficiency observed in molecular machines.Cells must operate far from equilibrium, utilizing and dissipating energy continuously to maintain their organization and to avoid stasis and death. However, they must also avoid unnecessary waste of energy. Recent studies have revealed that molecular machines are extremely efficient thermodynamically compared with their macroscopic counterparts. However, the principles governing the efficient out-of-equilibrium operation of molecular machines remain a mystery. A theoretical framework has been recently formulated in which a generalized friction coefficient quantifies the energetic efficiency in nonequilibrium processes. Moreover, it posits that, to minimize energy dissipation, external control should drive the system along the reaction coordinate with a speed inversely proportional to the square root of that friction coefficient. Here, we demonstrate the utility of this theory for designing and understanding energetically efficient nonequilibrium processes through the unfolding and folding of single DNA hairpins.},

Infestation levels have resurged across the United States in recent decades, and cities and states are debating strategies to deal with them. Here, we introduce a mathematical model to study the spread of bed bugs and predict the costs and benefits of policies aimed at controlling them. In particular, we evaluate disclosure, a policy that requires landlords to notify potential tenants of recent infestations in a unit. While disclosure aims to protect individual tenants, our results suggest that these policies also reduce infestation prevalence market-wide. Disclosure results in some initial cost to landlords but leads to significant savings in the long term.Bed bugs have reemerged in the United States and worldwide over recent decades, presenting a major challenge to both public health practitioners and housing authorities. A number of municipalities have proposed or initiated policies to stem the bed bug epidemic, but little guidance is available to evaluate them. One contentious policy is disclosure, whereby landlords are obligated to notify potential tenants of current or prior bed bug infestations. Aimed to protect tenants from leasing an infested rental unit, disclosure also creates a kind of quarantine, partially and temporarily removing infested units from the market. Here, we develop a mathematical model for the spread of bed bugs in a generalized rental market, calibrate it to parameters of bed bug dispersion and housing turnover, and use it to evaluate the costs and benefits of disclosure policies to landlords. We find disclosure to be an effective control policy to curb infestation prevalence. Over the short term (within 5 years), disclosure policies result in modest increases in cost to landlords, while over the long term, reductions of infestation prevalence lead, on average, to savings. These results are insensitive to different assumptions regarding the prevalence of infestation, rate of introduction of bed bugs from other municipalities, and the strength of the quarantine effect created by disclosure. Beyond its application to bed bugs, our model offers a framework to evaluate policies to curtail the spread of household pests and is appropriate for systems in which spillover effects result in highly nonlinear cost{\textendash}benefit relationships.},

Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated separately. In this situation the viral genome is not recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral system is functional through complementation across cells. Our observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.},

	abstract = {In nature, self-replication and exponential growth are common. Here we introduce a system of artificial self-replicators based on DNA origami cross-tile motifs. Unlike previous systems based on making a single copy of a parent template, the cross-tile systems, like many natural species, can produce {\textquotedblleft}litters{\textquotedblright} of offspring per generation. The cross-tiles enable a ladder-like structure to crystallize from the template on cooling. UV exposure covalently binds the assembled components of the offspring and heating releases the autonomous daughters from the parent, up to 10 offspring per cycle. The enhanced growth rate speeds up experimental studies and provides an evolutionary advantage for selection.Self-replication and exponential growth are ubiquitous in nature but until recently there were few examples of artificial self-replication. Often replication is a templated process where a parent produces a single offspring, doubling the population in each generation. Many species however produce more than one offspring at a time, enabling faster population growth and higher probability of species perpetuation. We have made a system of cross-shaped origami tiles that yields a number of offspring, four to eight or more, depending on the concentration of monomer units to be assembled. The parent dimer template serves as a seed to crystallize a one-dimensional crystal, a ladder. The ladder rungs are then UV{\textendash}cross-linked and the offspring are then released by heating, to yield a litter of autonomous daughters. In the complement study, we also optimize the growth conditions to speed up the process and yield a 103 increase in the growth rate for the single-offspring replication system. Self-replication and exponential growth of autonomous motifs is useful for fundamental studies of selection and evolution as well as for materials design, fabrication, and directed evolution. Methods that increase the growth rate, the primary evolutionary drive, not only speed up experiments but provide additional mechanisms for evolving materials toward desired functionalities.},

Our study connects intracellular physiology to macroscale collective behaviors during multicellular development, spanning five orders of magnitude in length and six orders of magnitude in time, using bacterial swarming as a model system. This work is enabled by a high-throughput adaptive microscopy technique, which we combined with genetics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling to reveal the phase diagram of bacterial swarming and that cell{\textendash}cell interactions within each swarming phase are dominated by mechanical interactions.Coordinated dynamics of individual components in active matter are an essential aspect of life on all scales. Establishing a comprehensive, causal connection between intracellular, intercellular, and macroscopic behaviors has remained a major challenge due to limitations in data acquisition and analysis techniques suitable for multiscale dynamics. Here, we combine a high-throughput adaptive microscopy approach with machine learning, to identify key biological and physical mechanisms that determine distinct microscopic and macroscopic collective behavior phases which develop as Bacillus subtilis swarms expand over five orders of magnitude in space. Our experiments, continuum modeling, and particle-based simulations reveal that macroscopic swarm expansion is primarily driven by cellular growth kinetics, whereas the microscopic swarming motility phases are dominated by physical cell{\textendash}cell interactions. These results provide a unified understanding of bacterial multiscale behavioral complexity in swarms.},

	abstract = {Desert ants have been shown to use olfaction to pinpoint food and find their nest after far-reaching foraging runs. Here we show that the ants can learn new food and nest odors and that they posses two distinct memories for both contexts. While ants need several training trials to learn a nest odor, and forget about this odor shortly after training has stopped, they learn food odors after one trial, remember them over a lifetime, and can remember at least 14 different food odors. These different memory characteristics make sense, as food is unpredictable and ants might experience many different food items in consecutive foraging runs, while the nest odor will not dramatically change during an ant{\textquoteright}s lifetime.The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis inhabits the North African saltpans where it individually forages for dead arthropods. Homing ants rely mainly on path integration, i.e., the processing of directional information from a skylight compass and distance information from an odometer. Due to the far-reaching foraging runs, path integration is error-prone and guides the ants only to the vicinity of the nest, where the ants then use learned visual and olfactory cues to locate the inconspicuous nest entrance. The learning of odors associated with the nest entrance is well established. We furthermore know that foraging Cataglyphis use the food-derived necromone linoleic acid to pinpoint dead insects. Here we show that Cataglyphis in addition can learn the association of a given odor with food. After experiencing food crumbs that were spiked with an innately neutral odor, ants were strongly attracted by the same odor during their next foraging journey. We therefore explored the characteristics of the ants{\textquoteright} food-odor memory and identified pronounced differences from their memory for nest-associated odors. Nest odors are learned only after repeated learning trials and become ignored as soon as the ants do not experience them at the nest anymore. In contrast, ants learn food odors after a single experience, remember at least 14 consecutively learned food odors, and do so for the rest of their lives. As an ant experiences many food items during its lifetime, but only a single nest, differentially organized memories for both contexts might be adaptive.},

@article{rajakumar2018social,
	Abstract = {The origin of complex worker-caste systems in ants perplexed Darwin1 and has remained an enduring problem for evolutionary and developmental biology2--6. Ants originated approximately 150 million years ago, and produce colonies with winged queen and male castes as well as a wingless worker caste7. In the hyperdiverse genus Pheidole, the wingless worker caste has evolved into two morphologically distinct subcastes---small-headed minor workers and large-headed soldiers8. The wings of queens and males develop from populations of cells in larvae that are called wing imaginal discs7. Although minor workers and soldiers are wingless, vestiges or rudiments of wing imaginal discs appear transiently during soldier development7,9--11. Such rudimentary traits are phylogenetically widespread and are primarily used as evidence of common descent, yet their functional importance remains equivocal1,12--14. Here we show that the growth of rudimentary wing discs is necessary for regulating allometry---disproportionate scaling---between head and body size to generate large-headed soldiers in the genus Pheidole. We also show that Pheidole colonies have evolved the capacity to socially regulate the growth of rudimentary wing discs to control worker subcaste determination, which allows these colonies to maintain the ratio of minor workers to soldiers. Finally, we provide comparative and experimental evidence that suggests that rudimentary wing discs have facilitated the parallel evolution of complex worker-caste systems across the ants. More generally, rudimentary organs may unexpectedly acquire novel regulatory functions during development to facilitate adaptive evolution.},
