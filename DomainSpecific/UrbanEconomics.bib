abstract="We deal with the location-quantity problem for competing firms when they locate multiple facilities and offer the same type of product. Competition is performed under delivered quantities that are sent from the facilities to the customers. This problem is reduced to a location game when the competing firms deliver the Cournot equilibrium quantities. While existence conditions for a Nash equilibrium of the location game have been discussed in many contributions in the literature, computing an equilibrium on a network when multiple facilities are to be located by each firm is a problem not previously addressed. We propose an integer linear programming formulation to fill this gap. The formulation solves the profit maximization problem for a firm, assuming that the other firms have fixed their facility locations. This allows us to compute location Nash equilibria by the best response procedure. A study with data of Spanish municipalities under different scenarios is presented and conclusions are drawn from a sensitivity analysis.",

abstract="This article investigates the selection of a distance measure in location modeling. While in the empirical literature the choice usually boils down to picking one single measure, this research proposes a flexible approach in which several measures may be used in parallel to capture the surrounding economic landscape. This is intended to acknowledge that interactions between agents may take several forms, occurring through different channels and as such being based on different measures. The methodology is applied to the location choice of establishments in the Paris region, using a mixture of ''mono-distance'' hurdle-Poisson models. Seven distance measures are considered: Euclidean distance, the travel times by car (for the peak and off-peak periods) and by public transit, and the corresponding network distances. For all the economic sectors considered, the mixture of hurdle-Poisson models performs significantly better than the ``pure'' mono-distance models. This corroborates that local spatial spillovers are indeed channeled by different means, hence best represented using several measures. The combination of peak and off-peak road travel times (slightly) outperforms other combinations including the Euclidean distance, supporting the choice of meaningful over more abstract measures in spatial econometric models. The distance measure most likely to capture local spatial spillovers varies depending on the economic sector examined, reflecting differences between sectors in operations and location choice criteria.",

abstract="This paper introduces a clear distinction between interregional and intraregional transportation cost in a mixed New Economic Geography and Urban Economics model (Krugman and Livas Elizondo 1996; Martin and Rogers 1995). With the assumptions that public spending on transport infrastructure has some different effects on city size and welfare, and that it is financed by a proportional tax on regional income, an absence of regulation enables productive activities to agglomerate in the most favored region. Considering the presence of urban costs (e.g. commuting costs and land rents), public transport policy for developed countries can be used as a strategic instrument for regional planning, leading to a decrease in the spatial size of cities.",

abstract = {How urban characteristics change with total population, their scaling behavior, has become an important research field since one needs to better understand the challenges of urban densification. Yet urban scaling research is largely disconnected from intra-urban structure, and this seriously limits its operationalization. In contrast, the monocentric model of Alonso provides a residential choice-based theory to urban density profiles. However, dedicated comparative static analyses do not completely solve how the model scales with population. This article bridges this gap by simultaneously introducing power laws for land, income and transport cost in the Alonso model. We show that the equilibrium urban structure of this augmented model matches recent empirical findings about the scaling of European population density profiles and satisfactorily represents European cities. This result is however not compatible with the observed scaling power of housing land profiles, and challenges current empirical understanding of wage and transport cost elasticities with population. Our results call for revisiting theories about land development and housing processes as well as the empirics of agglomeration benefits and transport costs.},

journal="Networks and Spatial Economics",
year="2019",
month="Jan",
day="24",
abstract="Random-utility-based multiregional input--output (RUBMRIO) models are used to study the impact of changes in transport networks or spatial economies on interregional or international trade patterns. These models rely on elastic prices algorithms to estimate trade flows. According to the literature, two different RUBMRIO elastic prices algorithms exist: an original algorithm that was the subject of theoretical investigation, and a modified algorithm that has been commonly used in practice. The original algorithm measures prices and acquisition costs in dollars, whereas the modified algorithm measures prices and acquisition costs in units of utility. By deriving the equivalence conditions of these algorithms, it is proven that the modified algorithm is only equivalent to the original algorithm under very restrictive conditions: first, initial sector prices must be the same in each region; second, cost parameters must be the same for all industries; and third, no other variables can be introduced into the original trade coefficient model specification. In a numerical example, the modified algorithm results in a mean absolute percentage error of 56{\%} for trade flow values. Due to these restrictions, it is recommended that future studies adopt the approach of determining initial RUBMRIO prices endogenously before calibration, which are shown be solved directly from a system of linear equations, and applying the original RUBMRIO elastic prices algorithm (measuring prices in dollars).",

abstract="Daily Urban Systems (DUSs) are not only an attractive concept for planning locations for jobs, housing, schools and retail, but also for managing services such as public transportation and health care. If we can match geographically demand and supply of goods and services, higher levels of spatial efficiency can be reached. Since 50Â years most of the research delineating DUSs uses thresholds of commuting levels, thus identifying labor markets polarized towards central cities. Few research grasps the more recent complex interactions within metropolitan areas due to growth and decentralization of activities. In this paper, we use techniques of complex network theory, namely community detection, on nearly 4,500,000 Belgian commuting links to define DUSs. Secondly, we explore differences for DUSs by gender and by income group. The results confirm the usefulness of community detection techniques for delineating Daily Urban Systems. Commuting patterns of females and low and very low income commuters are geographically more restricted than those of male and high and very high income commuters.",

month="Nov",
day="06",
abstract="Racetrack economy is a conventional spatial platform for economic agglomeration in spatial economy models. Studies of this economy up to now have been conducted mostly on 2k cities, for which agglomerations proceed via so-called spatial period doubling bifurcation cascade. This paper aims at the elucidation of agglomeration mechanisms of the racetrack economy in a general setting of an arbitrary number of cities. First, an attention was paid to the existence of invariant solutions that retain their spatial distributions when the transport cost parameter is changed. A complete list of possible invariant solutions, which are inherent for replicator dynamics and are dependent on the number of cities, is presented. Next, group-theoretic bifurcation theory is used to describe bifurcation from the uniform state, thereby presenting an insightful information on spatial agglomerations. Among a plethora of theoretically possible invariant solutions, those which actually become stable for spatial economy models are obtained numerically. Asymptotic agglomeration behavior when the number of cities become very large is studied.",

abstract="The organization of modern economies is built upon an efficient transport system and an increasing role is played by the logistics sector in overcoming the constraints of time and distance in modern supply chains. While a large body of literature is dedicated to the spatial distribution of firms and firm location choice in general, surprisingly little is still known about the location patterns of logistics firms, and more specifically about the role of accessibility in their location decisions. We use geo-referenced firm level data along with detailed information on transport infrastructure in order to investigate the geography of logistics firms in Spain. We place specific attention to the relationship between logistics firm location, accessibility, and urban structure. Our results show that these firms are located closer to highways and other transport infrastructure compared to other sectors and that the logistics sector is highly urbanized. Yet, they are also locating increasingly in suburban locations and to some extent in extra-urban locations with good accessibility while central cities of urban areas have experienced a declining share of logistics firms.",
