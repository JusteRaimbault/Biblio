	abstract = {Regrowth of forests following past disturbances is expected to be an important driver behind the large uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions by the terrestrial biosphere. Yet estimates of the size of this uptake vary widely. We combined independent observation-based and model-based sources of disturbance history information to calculate the carbon sink in regrowth forests. On-going carbon uptake due to forest demography is large, but much smaller than previous influential estimates have suggested. Contrary to previous findings, these latest data sources indicate that the sink is predominantly in mid-high latitude, rather than tropical, forests. The remaining uptake potential in forest biomass under current disturbance rates is equivalent to 7 years of emissions from fossil fuel burning at 2016 levels.Although the existence of a large carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems is well-established, the drivers of this sink remain uncertain. It has been suggested that perturbations to forest demography caused by past land-use change, management, and natural disturbances may be causing a large component of current carbon uptake. Here we use a global compilation of forest age observations, combined with a terrestrial biosphere model with explicit modeling of forest regrowth, to partition the global forest carbon sink between old-growth and regrowth stands over the period 1981{\textendash}2010. For 2001{\textendash}2010 we find a carbon sink of 0.85 (0.66{\textendash}0.96) Pg year-1 located in intact old-growth forest, primarily in the moist tropics and boreal Siberia, and 1.30 (1.03{\textendash}1.96) Pg year-1 located in stands regrowing after past disturbance. Approaching half of the sink in regrowth stands would have occurred from demographic changes alone, in the absence of other environmental changes. These age-constrained results show consistency with those simulated using an ensemble of demographically-enabled terrestrial biosphere models following an independent reconstruction of historical land use and management. We estimate that forests will accumulate an additional 69 (44{\textendash}131) Pg C in live biomass from changes in demography alone if natural disturbances, wood harvest, and reforestation continue at rates comparable to those during 1981{\textendash}2010. Our results confirm that it is not possible to understand the current global terrestrial carbon sink without accounting for the sizeable sink due to forest demography. They also imply that a large portion of the current terrestrial carbon sink is strictly transient in nature.},

	abstract = {Termites are important decomposers of plant material in tropical ecosystems, and thereby produce globally significant amounts of the greenhouse gas CH4. Here, we provide a mechanistic understanding of CH4 turnover in termite mounds to fill a long-standing knowledge gap. Using field measurements, we show that termite mounds oxidize, on average, half of the CH4 produced by termites before emission. This {\textquotedblleft}hidden{\textquotedblright} biofilter mechanism is mediated by methanotrophic bacteria living in the mound walls or the soil beneath, for which internal termite-mound structures can facilitate CH4 transport. Process links within the mound stabilize the filter efficiency. Moreover, we estimate undisturbed termite biomass via CH4 emissions. This knowledge is crucial to reduce uncertainty in global termite-derived CH4 emissions.Termites are responsible for \~{}1 to 3\% of global methane (CH4) emissions. However, estimates of global termite CH4 emissions span two orders of magnitude, suggesting that fundamental knowledge of CH4 turnover processes in termite colonies is missing. In particular, there is little reliable information on the extent and location of microbial CH4 oxidation in termite mounds. Here, we use a one-box model to unify three independent field methods{\textemdash}a gas-tracer test, an inhibitor approach, and a stable-isotope technique{\textemdash}and quantify CH4 production, oxidation, and transport in three North Australian termite species with different feeding habits and mound architectures. We present systematic in situ evidence of widespread CH4 oxidation in termite mounds, with 20 to 80\% of termite-produced CH4 being mitigated before emission to the atmosphere. Furthermore, closing the CH4 mass balance in mounds allows us to estimate in situ termite biomass from CH4 turnover, with mean biomass ranging between 22 and 86 g of termites per kilogram of mound for the three species. Field tests with excavated mounds show that the predominant location of CH4 oxidation is either in the mound material or the soil beneath and is related to species-specific mound porosities. Regardless of termite species, however, our data and model suggest that the fraction of oxidized CH4 (fox) remains well buffered due to links among consumption, oxidation, and transport processes via mound CH4 concentration. The mean fox of 0.50 {\textpm} 0.11 (95\% CI) from in situ measurements therefore presents a valid oxidation factor for future global estimates of termite CH4 emissions.},

	abstract = {Wildfires are a major source of fine particulate matter (diameter \&lt;2.5 {\textmu}m; PM2.5), which is a health hazard. Since the mid-1980s, the total US area burned by wildfires has been increasing, with fires in the Northwest United States accounting for \~{}50{\textendash}60\% of that increase. In the Northwest United States, we find a positive trend in the 98th quantile of PM2.5 in contrast to other areas of the country where PM2.5 is decreasing. This positive trend in PM2.5 is closely associated with total carbon (a marker of wildfire emissions). These results support model predictions of increasing wildfire occurrence and PM2.5 in a warming world.Using data from rural monitoring sites across the contiguous United States, we evaluated fine particulate matter (PM2.5) trends for 1988{\textendash}2016. We calculate trends in the policy-relevant 98th quantile of PM2.5 using Quantile Regression. We use Kriging and Gaussian Geostatistical Simulations to interpolate trends between observed data points. Overall, we found positive trends in 98th quantile PM2.5 at sites within the Northwest United States (average 0.21 {\textpm} 0.12 {\textmu}g{\textperiodcentered}m-3{\textperiodcentered}y-1; {\textpm}95\% confidence interval). This was in contrast with sites throughout the rest of country, which showed a negative trend in 98th quantile PM2.5, likely due to reductions in anthropogenic emissions (average -0.66 {\textpm} 0.10 {\textmu}g{\textperiodcentered}m-3{\textperiodcentered}y-1). The positive trend in 98th quantile PM2.5 is due to wildfire activity and was supported by positive trends in total carbon and no trend in sulfate across the Northwest. We also evaluated daily moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) for 2002{\textendash}2017 throughout the United States to compare with ground-based trends. For both Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) PM2.5 and MODIS AOD datasets, we found positive 98th quantile trends in the Northwest (1.77 {\textpm} 0.68\% and 2.12 {\textpm} 0.81\% per year, respectively) through 2016. The trend in Northwest AOD is even greater if data for the high-fire year of 2017 are included. These results indicate a decrease in PM2.5 over most of the country but a positive trend in the 98th quantile PM2.5 across the Northwest due to wildfires.},

International food trade plays an important role in global food security. It is widely believed that importing countries benefit environmentally from international food trade at the environmental cost of exporting countries. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, our study reveals a major environmental problem in importing countries. The unexpected findings suggest the need to reevaluate environmental consequences of international trade in all importing countries through discussions regarding environmental responsibilities among consumers and producers. There is an urgent need for innovative solutions for reducing environmental pollution and enhancing food security to offset the negative impacts of international trade globally.Protecting the environment and enhancing food security are among the world{\textquoteright}s Sustainable Development Goals and greatest challenges. International food trade is an important mechanism to enhance food security worldwide. Nonetheless, it is widely concluded that in international food trade importing countries gain environmental benefits, while exporting countries suffer environmental problems by using land and other resources to produce food for exports. Our study shows that international food trade can also lead to environmental pollution in importing countries. At the global level, our metaanalysis indicates that there was increased nitrogen (N) pollution after much farmland for domestically cultivated N-fixing soybeans in importing countries was converted to grow high N-demanding crops (wheat, corn, rice, and vegetables). The findings were further verified by an intensive study at the regional level in China, the largest soybean-importing country, where the conversion of soybean lands to corn fields and rice paddies has also led to N pollution. Our study provides a sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that only exports contribute substantially to environmental woes. Our results suggest the need to evaluate environmental consequences of international trade of all other major goods and products in all importing countries, which have significant implications for fundamental rethinking in global policy-making and debates on environmental responsibilities among consumers, producers, and traders across the world.},

										abstract = {Glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) are important water sources for millions of people downstream. Ice cliffs on debris-covered glaciers act as hot spots for melt and may explain anomalously high glacier mass losses in HMA, but their temporal evolution remains unknown, hindering sound parameterizations of these features in glacier models. We simulate the evolution of cliff systems with different aspects, show that south-facing ice cliffs disappear within a few weeks in the Northern Hemisphere, and explain the processes driving this. Cliffs that persist melt 10 times faster than the surrounding glacier surfaces. These findings provide a basis for understanding the surface evolution of debris-covered glaciers with implications for their dynamics, mass balance, and hydrology.Supraglacial ice cliffs exist on debris-covered glaciers worldwide, but despite their importance as melt hot spots, their life cycle is little understood. Early field observations had advanced a hypothesis of survival of north-facing and disappearance of south-facing cliffs, which is central for predicting the contribution of cliffs to total glacier mass losses. Their role as windows of energy transfer suggests they may explain the anomalously high mass losses of debris-covered glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) despite the insulating debris, currently at the center of a debated controversy. We use a 3D model of cliff evolution coupled to very high-resolution topographic data to demonstrate that ice cliffs facing south (in the Northern Hemisphere) disappear within a few months due to enhanced solar radiation receipts and that aspect is the key control on cliffs evolution. We reproduce continuous flattening of south-facing cliffs, a result of their vertical gradient of incoming solar radiation and sky view factor. Our results establish that only north-facing cliffs are recurrent features and thus stable contributors to the melting of debris-covered glaciers. Satellite observations and mass balance modeling confirms that few south-facing cliffs of small size exist on the glaciers of Langtang, and their contribution to the glacier volume losses is very small (\~{}1\%). This has major implications for the mass balance of HMA debris-covered glaciers as it provides the basis for new parameterizations of cliff evolution and distribution to constrain volume losses in a region where glaciers are highly relevant as water sources for millions of people.},
