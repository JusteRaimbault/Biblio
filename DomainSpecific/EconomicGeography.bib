abstract = {Zipf's law is one of the best known empirical regularities in urban economics. There is extensive research on the subject, where each city is treated symmetrically in terms of the cost of transactions with other cities. Recent developments in network theory facilitate the examination of an asymmetric transport network. In a scale-free network, the chance of observing extremes in network connections becomes higher than the Gaussian distribution predicts and, therefore, it explains the emergence of large clusters. The city-size distribution shares the same pattern. This paper decodes how accessibility of a city to other cities on the transportation network can boost its local economy and explains the city-size distribution as a result of its underlying transportation network structure. We confirm our model predictions with US and Belgian data. Finally, we discuss the endogenous evolution of transport networks.},,

abstract="This paper introduces a multi-country multi-regional model that allows the evaluation of the effects of trade openness in the distribution of economic activity across regions within countries. Relying on the agglomeration and dispersion forces characterizing the analytical framework of the New Economic Geography and New Trade Theory (neg/ntt) literature, we consider a general model with two differentiated sectors in terms of preferences, technologies and transport costs, allowing for any feasible world trade network topology where trade frictions are both transport and non-transport related (tariffs). We study systematically the critical thresholds that characterize the long run equilibria of economic activity. As benchmark simulations we choose two opposed domestic network topologies characterizing a homogeneous space and a heterogeneous space with some regions enjoying locational advantages. Our findings show that trade openness changes locational patterns in favor of better located regions with respect to the new world topology, which nevertheless may result in larger or lower spatial equality depending on the initial distribution of the economic activity. These results entail important implications in terms of transport infrastructure (accessibility) and trade (commercial agreements) policies, as both are interrelated when policy makers set regional equality goals.",
