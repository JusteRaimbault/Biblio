	abstract = {Disinformation continues to raise concerns due to its increasing threat to society. Nevertheless, a threat of a disinformation-based attack on critical infrastructure is often overlooked. Here, we consider urban traffic networks and focus on fake information that manipulates drivers'decisions to create congestion at a city scale. Specifically, we consider two complementary scenarios, one where drivers are persuaded to move towards a given location, and another where they are persuaded to move away from it. We study the optimization problem faced by the adversary when choosing which streets to target to maximize disruption. We prove that finding an optimal solution is computationally intractable, implying that the adversary has no choice but to settle for suboptimal heuristics. We analyze one such heuristic, and compare the cases when targets are spread across the city of Chicago vs. concentrated in its business district. Surprisingly, the latter results in more far-reaching disruption, with its impact felt as far as 2 km from the closest target. Our findings demonstrate that vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure may arise not only from hardware and software, but also from behavioral manipulation.},

	abstract = {Different traffic states experienced by commuters may be due to localized random jams or overall network states, which is decided by system response to perturbations. While for natural systems, the existence of multiple states is common, the evidence for multiple states in transportation has so far been unclear, which hinders our ability to predict and prevent the spread of traffic jams. Based on percolation theory and high-resolution GPS datasets, we find strong evidence for the existence of multiple metastable network states corresponding to distinct system performance regimes. Our results may provide deep insight for a city traffic manager seeking to design early warning signals to prevent the system from shifting to a state of severe congestion.While abrupt regime shifts between different metastable states have occurred in natural systems from many areas including ecology, biology, and climate, evidence for this phenomenon in transportation systems has been rarely observed so far. This limitation might be rooted in the fact that we lack methods to identify and analyze possible multiple states that could emerge at scales of the entire traffic network. Here, using percolation approaches, we observe such a metastable regime in traffic systems. In particular, we find multiple metastable network states, corresponding to varying levels of traffic performance, which recur over different days. Based on high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) datasets of urban traffic in the megacities of Beijing and Shanghai (each with over 50,000 road segments), we find evidence supporting the existence of tipping points separating three regimes: a global functional regime and a metastable hysteresis-like regime, followed by a global collapsed regime. We can determine the intrinsic critical points where the metastable hysteresis-like regime begins and ends and show that these critical points are very similar across different days. Our findings provide a better understanding of traffic resilience patterns and could be useful for designing early warning signals for traffic resilience management and, potentially, other complex systems.The datasets analyzed in the current study are not publicly available under the restrictions of the data provider, but they are available upon request from the corresponding author(s).},

abstract="The rapid growth of population in urban areas is jeopardizing the mobility and air quality worldwide. One of the most notable problems arising is that of traffic congestion which in turn affects air pollution. With the advent of technologies able to sense real-time data about cities, and its public distribution for analysis, we are in place to forecast scenarios valuable to ameliorate and control congestion. Here, we analyze a local congestion pricing scheme, hotspot pricing, that surcharges vehicles traversing congested junctions. The proposed tax is computed from the estimation of the evolution of congestion at local level, and the expected response of users to the tax (elasticity). Results on cities' road networks, considering real-traffic data, show that the proposed hotspot pricing scheme would be more effective than current mechanisms to decongest urban areas, and paves the way towards sustainable congestion in urban areas.",

title="Urban Activity Mining Framework for Ride Sharing Systems Based on Vehicular Social Networks",
journal="Networks and Spatial Economics",
year="2019",
month="May",
day="07",
abstract="Ride sharing has been widely studied over the past several decades as a means of reducing traffic and pollution by utilizing empty car seats in vehicles that are being driven no matter what. As they increase in popularity, ride sharing applications have already encountered several challenges: Vehicle allocation, price strategy, and route planning, are just a few such examples among many. Tracking human activity patterns with regard to ride share applications can potentially improve these systems in numerous ways. For example, taxi GPS trajectories offer a remarkable source of data for determining human activity patterns, among other things, in cities across the world. However, existing studies either focus solely on meeting order requirements or analyzing Points Of Interest (POI) based only on static information. The former issue cannot solve problems with balancing vehicle allocation, while the latter cannot precisely describe the POI locational feature. In order to develop a more specific analysis of activity patterns for ride sharing systems, we propose a Vehicular Social Network Based Analytical Framework (NBAF) to determine the specific urban activity of ride sharing systems at a low computational cost. The analytical framework contains two special contributions: Firstly, a novel trip mapping method named Trip-Embedding POI Decomposition Method (TEPID) is proposed to describe the feature of geo-nodes in the network. Secondly, the particular features for ride sharing systems are generated by vehicular social networks. Based on this framework, we propose a clustering method to reveal trip activity and regional features. As a case study, we analyze 30 days of taxi trips in New York City in 2016. The results demonstrate that NBAF can effectively determine urban activity and location patterns for vehicle allocation, price strategy, and route planning for ride sharing systems.",

abstract="This paper proposes an accurate economic framework to determine the optimum inspection level---the number of ticket inspectors---in a long time window, in order to maximize the system-wide profit when fare evasion occurs. This is the first framework that introduces: i) a refined characterization of the passenger demand, ii) a profit function with new constraints, iii) an alternative estimation of the percentage of passengers who choose to evade, and iv) a new formulation accounting for inspectors who cannot fine every passenger caught evading. The implementation of this framework is illustrated by using six years of data gathered from an Italian public transport company. Based on 57,256 stop-level inspections and 21,827 on-board personal interviews, the optimum inspection rate maximizing the profit is in the range of 3.4{\%}-4.0{\%}. This outcome provides more accurate results, which are discussed and compared to previous research. Finally, the framework is flexible, and it may be applied to any urban context in which proof-of-payment systems are adopted.",

	abstract = {Traffic congestion has become the most stubborn disease for the health of a city. Like the self-healing ability of a biological unit from diseases, transportation can also recover spontaneously from various disturbances. To describe this recovery, we define the resilience metric as the spatiotemporal congestion cluster, which can be used for other network systems. Based on large-scale GPS datasets, we reveal that the recovery behavior of transportation from congestion is governed by three scaling laws for all of the congestion scales. These scaling laws are found independent of microscopic details, including fluctuation of traffic demand and corresponding management. Our results of resilience scaling can help to better characterize and improve the adaptation and recovery of city traffic from various perturbations.The concept of resilience can be realized in natural and engineering systems, representing the ability of a system to adapt and recover from various disturbances. Although resilience is a critical property needed for understanding and managing the risks and collapses of transportation systems, an accepted and useful definition of resilience for urban traffic as well as its statistical property under perturbations are still missing. Here, we define city traffic resilience based on the spatiotemporal clusters of congestion in real traffic and find that the resilience follows a scale-free distribution in 2D city road networks and 1D highways with different exponents but similar exponents on different days and in different cities. The traffic resilience is also revealed to have a scaling relation between the cluster size of the spatiotemporal jam and its recovery duration independent of microscopic details. Our findings of universal traffic resilience can provide an indication toward better understanding and designing of these complex engineering systems under internal and external disturbances.},

More importantly, how will mobility itself change as these independent operational vehicles first share and then dominate our roadways?

	abstract = {The transition between free flow and congestions in traffic can be observed in our daily life. Although this traffic phenomenon is well studied in highways, traffic in a network scale (representing a city) is far from being understood. A fundamental unsolved question is how the global flow in a city is being integrated from local flows. Here, we identify a fundamental mechanism of traffic organization in a network scale as a percolation process, and we show how global traffic breaks down when identified bottlenecks are congested. These bottlenecks evolve with time according to traffic dynamics and are different from structural bottleneck links found by traditional network analysis. Improvement of traffic on these bottlenecks can significantly improve the global traffic.A critical phenomenon is an intrinsic feature of traffic dynamics, during which transition between isolated local flows and global flows occurs. However, very little attention has been given to the question of how the local flows in the roads are organized collectively into a global city flow. Here we characterize this organization process of traffic as {\textquotedblleft}traffic percolation,{\textquotedblright} where the giant cluster of local flows disintegrates when the second largest cluster reaches its maximum. We find in real-time data of city road traffic that global traffic is dynamically composed of clusters of local flows, which are connected by bottleneck links. This organization evolves during a day with different bottleneck links appearing in different hours, but similar in the same hours in different days. A small improvement of critical bottleneck roads is found to benefit significantly the global traffic, providing a method to improve city traffic with low cost. Our results may provide insights on the relation between traffic dynamics and percolation, which can be useful for efficient transportation, epidemic control, and emergency evacuation.},

abstract = "Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) are now ubiquitous due to their plausible environmental and social benefits promoted by municipalities, operators and technology providers. Recent practices and literature however undermines many suggested benefits of BSS showing they mostly facilitate transport for already privileged demographics in increasingly exclusive urban cores. Additionally, case study performance estimates in Europe and North America commonly show low usage rates further undermining promoted benefits. In the context of urban transports existing social injustice, energy consumption and land use, which cannot be sustained, this work, drawing on data analysis, interviews and literature and media review in North America and Europe, presents how existing BSS deployments have intrinsic flaws. These convenient luxuries are typically not effective or less so than familiar, proven and less technologically innovative opportunities at achieving greater cycling modal share. This paper illustrates how with BSS deployments converge many actors, promoting success and beneficial narratives, gain advantage through diverse outcomes while residents subsidize the services economically, through public land or advertising, while receiving few benefits. Municipalities and decision makers regularly use BSS to promote themselves, their city, attract investment and develop local pride in representatives and their policy. Beyond being a good example of policy boosterism and rich in rhetoric, BSS often have less effective or just outcomes than alternative transport policies. Advertisers meanwhile utilize sustainability narratives to capitalize on new markets and commodification opportunities while effectively undermining promoted BSS outcomes. This paper provides a critical history of BSS, summarizes their stated purposes and benefits and utilizes a smart-city critique framework to evaluate outcomes. This work concludes that most BSS typically benefit the privileged, help little to increase mass cycling transport and are used as easily deployable technological (false) solutions to contemporary problems while advancing unjust tendencies to privatize public space and services.",

In this paper, the relationship between the demand of ridesharing passengers (RPs), ridesharing drivers (RDs) and solo drivers (SDs) in a ridesharing compensation scheme is studied by a stochastic ridesharing user equilibrium (SRUE), which contains a mode choice model and a route choice model. The mode choice model and the route choice model influence each other. The SRUE is first expressed as a fixed-point problem mathematically. Six possible states of OD pairs are discussed. Then the existence of SRUE is proved. The method of successive weighted averages is adopted to solve the problem. It is found that there will be a higher demand of ridesharing passengers for journeys with longer travel time. Moreover, with the increase of the ridesharing compensation, the demand of ridesharing passengers is not always decreasing, and the demand of ridesharing drivers is not always increasing.",

journal="Networks and Spatial Economics",

day="11",
abstract="Dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) is the most widely studied form of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), in which road travelers engage in a non-cooperative Nash-like game with departure time and route choices. DUE models describe and predict the time-varying traffic flows on a network consistent with traffic flow theory and travel behavior. This paper documents theoretical and numerical advances in synthesizing traffic flow theory and DUE modeling, by presenting a holistic computational theory of DUE, which is numerically implemented in a MATLAB package. In particular, the dynamic network loading (DNL) sub-problem is formulated as a system of differential algebraic equations based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards fluid dynamic model, which captures the formation, propagation and dissipation of physical queues as well as vehicle spillback on networks. Then, the fixed-point algorithm is employed to solve the DUE problems with simultaneous route and departure time choices on several large-scale networks. We make openly available the MATLAB package, which can be used to solve DUE problems on user-defined networks, aiming to not only facilitate benchmarking a wide range of DUE algorithms and solutions, but also offer researchers a platform to further develop their own models and applications.

	abstract = {With the same static road network, it is essentially unknown for urban traffic if traffic flows have the same spatial organization properties for different hours. Based on real-time high-resolution GPS data on the city scale, our results indicate two distinct modes characterized by different percolation critical exponents. The mode during rush hours on working days behaves like a 2D lattice with mainly short-range links, while the mode for other instants behaves like a small world (i.e., a lattice with long-range links). The difference between these two modes is explained here by the free flow on urban highways during nonrush hours, which is like adding long-range links in a 2D lattice. In contrast, during rush hours, such links almost disappear.Percolation transition is widely observed in networks ranging from biology to engineering. While much attention has been paid to network topologies, studies rarely focus on critical percolation phenomena driven by network dynamics. Using extensive real data, we study the critical percolation properties in city traffic dynamics. Our results suggest that two modes of different critical percolation behaviors are switching in the same network topology under different traffic dynamics. One mode of city traffic (during nonrush hours or days off) has similar critical percolation characteristics as small world networks, while the other mode (during rush hours on working days) tends to behave as a 2D lattice. This switching behavior can be understood by the fact that the high-speed urban roads during nonrush hours or days off (that are congested during rush hours) represent effective long-range connections, like in small world networks. Our results might be useful for understanding and improving traffic resilience.},

In this context, it is important to characterize the collapse of the network, defined as the transition from a characteristic travel time to orders of magnitude longer for the same distance traveled. In this multicity study, we unravel this complex phenomenon under various conditions of demand and translate it to the travel time of the individual drivers. First, we start with the current conditions, showing that there is a characteristic time τ that takes a representative group of commuters to arrive at their destinations once their maximum density has been reached. While this time differs from city to city, it can be explained by Γ, defined as the ratio of the vehicle miles traveled to the total vehicle distance the road network can support per hour. Modifying Γ can improve τ and directly inform planning and infrastructure interventions. In this study we focus on measuring the vulnerability of the system by increasing the volume of cars in the network, keeping the road capacity and the empirical spatial dynamics from origins to destinations unchanged. We identify three states of urban traffic, separated by two distinctive transitions. The first one describes the appearance of the first bottlenecks and the second one the collapse of the system. This collapse is marked by a given number of commuters in each city and it is formally characterized by a nonequilibrium phase transition.},

abstract="It is well reported that long commutes have a large detrimental effect on people's health and on the economy of cities. Interestingly, despite the strong impact on our daily lives, a simple way to measure the quality of urban transportation is still unknown. We performed data analysis on the transportation network of two large cities (Fortaleza and Dublin). By dividing each bus trajectory into equal pieces of space, we determine the distribution of time intervals for each trip, and we propose that the heterogeneity of the time distribution can be used to characterize the quality of that trip. Inspired by the use of the Gini coefficient to quantify the inequality level of income distribution, we used the Gini in order to characterize the heterogeneity level of the time distribution. We demonstrated that Gini coefficients are strongly correlated with peak usage of the mobility system, as well as the schedule delays in the system. Finally, our method can be used to find highly heterogeneous trips which have a large negative effect on the urban mobility and can help find new directions for new public planning strategies.",

abstract="This paper investigates the competition between HSR and the incumbent with vertical service differentiation for Indian corridors. As Indian government plans to invest in this new technology, strategic decisions pertaining to type of corridor, speed of HSR, HSR technology, given the competition scenario on that corridor becomes vital. The strategic interactions between the operators are modelled as a three staged game between the entrant and the incumbent considering the competition over fare and frequency to maximize different objective functions i.e. Profit and Social Welfare. Speed of HSR is taken as a strategic variable in the game with two levels of high speed, {\{}Low-H, High-H{\}}. This model is applied on two corridors of India of different length i.e. Bangalore-Delhi (competition with airlines with length of corridor being 2400 km) and Bangalore-Mysore (competition with bus with length of corridor being 150 km). Revealed and stated preference surveys are conducted for the passengers traveling on these corridors and a discrete choice model was estimated for both the corridors. These models were used to determine the modal share in the new hypothetical scenario which were in turn used in defining objective functions such as profits and social welfare. Various game scenarios characterized by sunk and variable cost of the modes are formulated and equilibrium for all demand levels is computed for both the corridors for these different objective functions. Results demonstrates variation in Nash equilibrium for different game scenarios and hence indicates the importance of incorporating speed as a strategic variable. Changing the objective function to social welfare maximization results in different equilibrium solution for Bangalore-Delhi corridor. Thus, impact of different combinations of demand, cost structures and objective functions are explored on the market equilibrium thereby providing interesting insights in this area.",

The reliability and resilience of this peculiar transportation system may be challenged by different shocks such as disruptions, strikes and adverse weather conditions. These events compromise the correct functioning of the system and trigger the spreading of delays into the railway network on a daily basis. Despite their importance, a general theoretical understanding of the underlying causes of these disruptions is still lacking. In this work, we analyse the Italian and German railway networks by leveraging on the train schedules and actual delay data retrieved during the year 2015. We use these data to infer simple statistical laws ruling the emergence of localized delays in different areas of the network and we model the spreading of these delays throughout the network by exploiting a framework inspired by epidemic spreading models. Our model offers a fast and easy tool for the preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of traffic handling policies, and of the railway network criticalities.",

abstract="This paper proposes an agent-based transport facility development model for both Conventional Vehicles (CVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), as a key component of an agent-based land use-transport model, SelfSim. The model attempts to simultaneously locate public parking lots, refuelling stations, charging stations and charging posts at parking lots with the consideration of competitions and interactions between the facilities. The facility development model is composed of a link-based model and node-based model that are used to simulate the development of link-based (e.g., replenishing stations) and node-based facilities (e.g., parking lots), respectively, based on the spatial and temporal disaggregate demand. The demand is extracted from the activity-based simulation with MATSim-EV that is an EV extension of MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation). In the model, facility agents are defined with several specific attributes and behavioural rules, and act the role of locating transport facilities to accommodate the demand. Finally, both global and local sensitivity analyses are applied to fully test the model in several experiments set up based on a Chinese medium-sized city, Baoding. The global SA that is based on Elementary Effect Method is firstly applied to quantify the extent to which the twelve model outputs of interest are sensitive to forty key model parameters, resulting in nine significantly important parameters; Then the Once-At-A-Time (OAT)-based local SA is used to provide further insight into how these important parameters influence the model outputs of interest over years. The SA results are expected to be useful for model calibration, and how the SA results can be used to calibrate the model is discussed.",

abstract="Subway and bus networks work as an integrated multiplex transportation system and play an indispensable role in modern big cities. Even though a variety of works have investigated the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks, empirical data that validates the determinant coupling factors are still lacking. In this paper, we employ smartcard data of 2.4 million subway and bus passengers in Shenzhen, China to study the coupling dynamics of subway and bus networks. Surprisingly, the coupling of subway and bus networks is not notably influenced by the time-varying speed ratio of the two network layers but is jointly determined by the distribution of travel demands and transportation facilities. Our findings highlight the important role of real travel demand data in analyzing the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks. They also suggest that the speed ratio of different network layers, which was regarded as a key factor in determining coupling strength, has a negligible effect on travelers' route selections, and thus the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks.",

		abstract="Travel demand can be viewed as a weighted and directed graph where nodes are the origins and destinations and links represent the trips between nodes. This paper presents a network-theoretic methodology to evaluate and validate travel demand models. We apply the proposed method on three disaggregate travel demand models from Melbourne, Australia. Statistical properties of the modeled networks are compared against the observed networks over time. The new approach reveals the network structure and connectivity of the modeled trips that are not usually captured by traditional evaluation and validation methods. Results demonstrate the complexity involved in the development, evaluation, and validation of travel demand models, which calls for advanced evaluation techniques reflecting a wide range of attributes of the observed and modeled data, travelers, mobility patterns, and complex network characteristics.",
