	abstract = {We develop and test a model that predicts the future lethality of a terror group. The model significantly increases the level of explained variance over existing models and presents early-warning signal predictions. Our early-warning model predicts the future lethality of a group using only a handful of events that occur soon after it emerges. Using the first 10 to 20 attacks or the first 10 to 20\% of a group{\textquoteright}s lifetime, our early-warning model provides about 60\% of the explanatory power as would having a group{\textquoteright}s complete lifetime data, which is a basis for improved counter insurgency resources.As terror groups proliferate and grow in sophistication, a major international concern is the development of scientific methods that explain and predict insurgent violence. Approaches to estimating a group{\textquoteright}s future lethality often require data on the group{\textquoteright}s capabilities and resources, but by the nature of the phenomenon, these data are intentionally concealed by the organizations themselves via encryption, the dark web, back-channel financing, and misinformation. Here, we present a statistical model for estimating a terror group{\textquoteright}s future lethality using latent-variable modeling techniques to infer a group{\textquoteright}s intrinsic capabilities and resources for inflicting harm. The analysis introduces 2 explanatory variables that are strong predictors of lethality and raise the overall explained variance when added to existing models. The explanatory variables generate a unique early-warning signal of an individual group{\textquoteright}s future lethality based on just a few of its first attacks. Relying on the first 10 to 20 attacks or the first 10 to 20\% of a group{\textquoteright}s lifetime behavior, our model explains about 60\% of the variance in a group{\textquoteright}s future lethality as would be explained by a group{\textquoteright}s complete lifetime data. The model{\textquoteright}s robustness is evaluated with out-of-sample testing and simulations. The findings{\textquoteright} theoretical and pragmatic implications for the science of human conflict are discussed.},

	abstract = {Spatially finest poverty maps are essential for improved diagnosis and policy planning, especially keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals. {\textquotedblleft}Big Data{\textquotedblright} sources like call data records and satellite imagery have shown promise in providing intercensal statistics. This study outlines a computational framework to efficiently combine disparate data sources, like environmental data, and mobile data, to provide more accurate predictions of poverty and its individual dimensions for finest spatial microregions in Senegal. These are validated using the concurrent census data.More than 330 million people are still living in extreme poverty in Africa. Timely, accurate, and spatially fine-grained baseline data are essential to determining policy in favor of reducing poverty. The potential of {\textquotedblleft}Big Data{\textquotedblright} to estimate socioeconomic factors in Africa has been proven. However, most current studies are limited to using a single data source. We propose a computational framework to accurately predict the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at a finest spatial granularity and coverage of 552 communes in Senegal using environmental data (related to food security, economic activity, and accessibility to facilities) and call data records (capturing individualistic, spatial, and temporal aspects of people). Our framework is based on Gaussian Process regression, a Bayesian learning technique, providing uncertainty associated with predictions. We perform model selection using elastic net regularization to prevent overfitting. Our results empirically prove the superior accuracy when using disparate data (Pearson correlation of 0.91). Our approach is used to accurately predict important dimensions of poverty: health, education, and standard of living (Pearson correlation of 0.84{\textendash}0.86). All predictions are validated using deprivations calculated from census. Our approach can be used to generate poverty maps frequently, and its diagnostic nature is, likely, to assist policy makers in designing better interventions for poverty eradication.},

	abstract = {Utilizing the latest, high-quality, 3-generation data, this article reports findings from a systematic study of the long-term impact of the Communist Revolution on the social stratification order in today{\textquoteright}s China. It is found that the revolution disrupted the cross-generational reproduction of the prevailing social stratification at the time of the revolution in promoting the social status of children of the peasant and worker classes and disadvantaging those from privileged classes. Despite a tendency for {\textquotedblleft}reversion{\textquotedblright} mitigating the revolution{\textquoteright}s effects in the third generation toward the grandparents{\textquoteright} generation in social status, the impact of the revolution on the educational attainment of descendants by class classification immediately following the revolution remains strong even after 6 decades have passed.The Chinese Communist Revolution that culminated in the 1949 founding of the People{\textquoteright}s Republic of China fundamentally transformed class relations in China. With data from a nationally representative, longitudinal survey between 2010 and 2016, this study documents the long-term impact of the Communist Revolution on the social stratification order in today{\textquoteright}s China, more than 6 decades after the revolution. True to its stated ideological missions, the revolution resulted in promoting the social status of children of the peasant, worker, and revolutionary cadre classes and disadvantaging those who were from privileged classes at the time of the revolution. Although there was a tendency toward {\textquotedblleft}reversion{\textquotedblright} mitigating the revolution{\textquoteright}s effects in the third generation toward the grandparents{\textquoteright} generation in social status, the overall impact of reversion was small. The revolution effects were most pronounced for the birth cohorts immediately following the revolution, attenuating for recently born cohorts.},

	abstract = {We reevaluate the level of subjective well-being in China with data from the China Household Finance Study. The analysis shows that in contrast to the decline in well-being reported in earlier studies, all groups report increased quality of life in the second decade of the 21st century. The analysis shows that the gap across rural and urban respondents is narrowing. Probit models of the levels of well-being show that social capital, measured as the perceived feelings of safety and security, community participation, and whether society is perceived to be fair, influence reported well-being. Household income, assets, health, being married, and the quality of neighborhood infrastructure, measured by availability of parks, primary schools, and hospitals, contributes positively to subjective well-being.There is now recognition that a population{\textquoteright}s overall level of well-being is defined not just by income and wealth. Where we live and who we interact with are likely to be equally important in our overall levels of satisfaction with our lives. This thinking has stimulated studies of subjective well-being, or happiness, at both national and local scales. These studies suggest that where you live does matter, although it is health and family status that have the most direct effects on well-being. In this study, we use a detailed dataset on well-being from the China Household Finance Survey to reexamine well-being across China, where profound socioeconomic changes are taking place. The study controls for self-reported health and examines subjective well-being across extensive and varied Chinese urban and rural environments. We find that the earlier pessimism about China{\textquoteright}s well-being, which emphasized declining happiness, may be misplaced. We make two contributions: first, we show a rising level of subjective well-being, and second, we show that there is a narrowing gap in well-being across different social indicators. Methodologically, we bring in the perspectives of both social capital and geographic context.},

	abstract = {Studies show that women are more risk averse than men. We explore sources and malleability of such differences in a setting where children of two culturally distinct populations, the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han, come together to attend school. Using survey and field experiments, we elicit individual risk attitudes from elementary and middle school students from the two populations. When they first enter school, Mosuo girls take more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls are more risk averse than Han boys, reflecting cultural differences. However, after spending time in the majority-Han environment, Mosuo children adopt the risk preferences of the majority. This shows that risk preferences are shaped by culture and malleable in response to new environments.Many studies find that women are more risk averse than men. Why does such a gender gap exist, and how malleable is this gender gap in risk aversion? The paper takes advantage of a rare setting in which children of the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han attend the same schools in Yunnan, China to shed light on these questions. In particular, we exploit the fact that children would experience a shock in gender norms when they start to intermingle with children from other ethnic groups with the opposite gender norms at school. Using survey and field experiments, we elicit risk attitudes from Mosuo and Han elementary and middle school students. We find that, at the time when they first enter school, Mosuo and Han children exhibit opposite gender norms{\textemdash}Mosuo girls take more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls are more risk averse than Han boys, reflecting cultural differences. However, after Mosuo students spend more time with Han students, Mosuo girls become more and more risk averse. By age 11, Mosuo girls are also more risk averse than Mosuo boys. We also observe a shrinking gap in risk aversion for Han over time. Using random roommate assignment for boarding middle school students, we find Mosuo boys who have fewer Mosuo roommates behave more similarly to Han boys. This shows that risk preferences are shaped by culture and malleable in response to new environments.},
