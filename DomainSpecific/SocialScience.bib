	abstract = {After a rapid expansion of primary school enrollment rates in many developing countries starting around 2000, progress toward development goals was widely acknowledged. However, the comprehensive focus on tested literacy skills presented in this paper shows that, in many countries, this expansion in quantity came at the expense of quality. Given the overriding importance of skilled human capital in modern knowledge societies, this is a worrisome trend with the possible negative implications of the current COVID-19 crisis on schooling possibly exacerbating the situation.Human capital, broadly defined as the skills acquired through formal education, is acknowledged as one of the key drivers of economic growth and social development. However, its measurement for the working-age populations, on a global scale and over time, is still unsatisfactory. Most indicators either only consider the quantity dimension of education and disregard the actual skills or are demographically inconsistent by applying the skills of the young cohorts in school to represent the skills of the working-age population at the same time. In the case of rapidly expanding or changing school systems, this assumption is untenable. However, an increasing number of countries have started to assess the literacy skills of their adult populations by age and sex directly. Drawing on this literacy data, and by using demographic backprojection and statistical estimation techniques, we here present a demographically consistent indicator for adult literacy skills, the skills in literacy adjusted mean years of schooling (SLAMYS). The measure is given for the population aged 20 to 64 in 185 countries and for the period 1970 to 2015. Compared to the conventional mean years of schooling (MYS){\textemdash}which has strongly increased for most countries over the past decades, and in particular among poor countries{\textemdash}the trends in SLAMYS exhibit a widening global skills gap between low- and high-performing countries.All study data are included in the article and/or supporting information.},

	abstract = {Intergenerational social mobility in the United States has declined over the last century, sparking a national debate about how to improve equality of opportunity. By analyzing data spanning the 20th century, we demonstrate strong temporal patterns operating across regions. Some areas of the United States have witnessed significant declines in social mobility, while others have had persistent low levels all along. Thus, the contemporary national picture is shaped by both powerful forces of change that reduce intergenerational mobility in some regions and deeply entrenched long-term forces generating persistence in others. It follows that improving social mobility will be challenging, as policy would need to respond to both forces and do so according to their varying mixture across different regions.New evidence shows that intergenerational social mobility{\textemdash}the rate at which children born into poverty climb the income ladder{\textemdash}varies considerably across the United States. Is this current geography of opportunity something new or does it reflect a continuation of long-term trends? We answer this question by constructing data on the levels and determinants of social mobility across American regions over the 20th century. We find that the changing geography of opportunity-generating economic activity restructures the landscape of intergenerational mobility, but factors associated with specific regional structures of interpersonal and racial inequality that have {\textquotedblleft}deep roots{\textquotedblright} generate persistence. This is evident in the sharp decline in social mobility in the Midwest as economic activity has shifted away from it and the consistently low levels of opportunity in the South even as economic activity has shifted toward it. We conclude that the long-term geography of social mobility can be understood through the deep roots and changing economic fortunes of places.Geographical estimates of intergenerational mobility data and replication files have been deposited in the repository of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), available at https://doi.org/10.3886/E125701V1.},

	abstract = {Social scientists have long debated whether commercial markets lead people to spend more time working. However, this issue has remained contentious due to the difficulty of measuring time allocation in less commercial, more subsistence-oriented societies. Here we use a high-quality dataset on time expenditure from 8 small-scale populations around the world to assess the relationship between work hours and market integration. Consistent with influential theories from anthropology and economic history, the evidence suggests that greater market integration is associated with more total time spent working by men. This increase in men{\textquoteright}s work time closes the gender gap with women, whose work is not linked to market integration. Incorporating data from industrialized countries reveals these patterns across societies as well.Does integration into commercial markets lead people to work longer hours? Does this mean that people in more subsistence-oriented societies work less compared to those in more market-integrated societies? Despite their venerable status in both anthropology and economic history, these questions have been difficult to address due to a dearth of appropriate data. Here, we tackle the issue by combining high-quality time allocation datasets from 8 small-scale populations around the world (45,019 observations of 863 adults) with similar aggregate data from 14 industrialized (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries. Both within and across societies, we find evidence of a positive correlation between work time and market engagement for men, although not for women. Shifting to fully commercial labor is associated with an increase in men{\textquoteright}s work from around 45 h per week to 55 h, on average; women{\textquoteright}s work remains at nearly 55 h per week across the spectrum. These results inform us about the socioeconomic determinants of time allocation across a wider range of human societies.},

The model significantly increases the level of explained variance over existing models and presents early-warning signal predictions. Our early-warning model predicts the future lethality of a group using only a handful of events that occur soon after it emerges. Using the first 10 to 20 attacks or the first 10 to 20\% of a group{\textquoteright}s lifetime, our early-warning model provides about 60\% of the explanatory power as would having a group{\textquoteright}s complete lifetime data, which is a basis for improved counter insurgency resources.As terror groups proliferate and grow in sophistication, a major international concern is the development of scientific methods that explain and predict insurgent violence. Approaches to estimating a group{\textquoteright}s future lethality often require data on the group{\textquoteright}s capabilities and resources, but by the nature of the phenomenon, these data are intentionally concealed by the organizations themselves via encryption, the dark web, back-channel financing, and misinformation. Here, we present a statistical model for estimating a terror group{\textquoteright}s future lethality using latent-variable modeling techniques to infer a group{\textquoteright}s intrinsic capabilities and resources for inflicting harm. The analysis introduces 2 explanatory variables that are strong predictors of lethality and raise the overall explained variance when added to existing models. The explanatory variables generate a unique early-warning signal of an individual group{\textquoteright}s future lethality based on just a few of its first attacks. Relying on the first 10 to 20 attacks or the first 10 to 20\% of a group{\textquoteright}s lifetime behavior, our model explains about 60\% of the variance in a group{\textquoteright}s future lethality as would be explained by a group{\textquoteright}s complete lifetime data. The model{\textquoteright}s robustness is evaluated with out-of-sample testing and simulations. The findings{\textquoteright} theoretical and pragmatic implications for the science of human conflict are discussed.},

This study outlines a computational framework to efficiently combine disparate data sources, like environmental data, and mobile data, to provide more accurate predictions of poverty and its individual dimensions for finest spatial microregions in Senegal. These are validated using the concurrent census data.More than 330 million people are still living in extreme poverty in Africa. Timely, accurate, and spatially fine-grained baseline data are essential to determining policy in favor of reducing poverty. The potential of {\textquotedblleft}Big Data{\textquotedblright} to estimate socioeconomic factors in Africa has been proven. However, most current studies are limited to using a single data source. We propose a computational framework to accurately predict the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at a finest spatial granularity and coverage of 552 communes in Senegal using environmental data (related to food security, economic activity, and accessibility to facilities) and call data records (capturing individualistic, spatial, and temporal aspects of people). Our framework is based on Gaussian Process regression, a Bayesian learning technique, providing uncertainty associated with predictions. We perform model selection using elastic net regularization to prevent overfitting. Our results empirically prove the superior accuracy when using disparate data (Pearson correlation of 0.91). Our approach is used to accurately predict important dimensions of poverty: health, education, and standard of living (Pearson correlation of 0.84{\textendash}0.86). All predictions are validated using deprivations calculated from census. Our approach can be used to generate poverty maps frequently, and its diagnostic nature is, likely, to assist policy makers in designing better interventions for poverty eradication.},

True to its stated ideological missions, the revolution resulted in promoting the social status of children of the peasant, worker, and revolutionary cadre classes and disadvantaging those who were from privileged classes at the time of the revolution. Although there was a tendency toward {\textquotedblleft}reversion{\textquotedblright} mitigating the revolution{\textquoteright}s effects in the third generation toward the grandparents{\textquoteright} generation in social status, the overall impact of reversion was small.

	abstract = {We reevaluate the level of subjective well-being in China with data from the China Household Finance Study. The analysis shows that in contrast to the decline in well-being reported in earlier studies, all groups report increased quality of life in the second decade of the 21st century. The analysis shows that the gap across rural and urban respondents is narrowing. Probit models of the levels of well-being show that social capital, measured as the perceived feelings of safety and security, community participation, and whether society is perceived to be fair, influence reported well-being. Household income, assets, health, being married, and the quality of neighborhood infrastructure, measured by availability of parks, primary schools, and hospitals, contributes positively to subjective well-being.There is now recognition that a population{\textquoteright}s overall level of well-being is defined not just by income and wealth. Where we live and who we interact with are likely to be equally important in our overall levels of satisfaction with our lives. This thinking has stimulated studies of subjective well-being, or happiness, at both national and local scales. These studies suggest that where you live does matter, although it is health and family status that have the most direct effects on well-being. In this study, we use a detailed dataset on well-being from the China Household Finance Survey to reexamine well-being across China, where profound socioeconomic changes are taking place. The study controls for self-reported health and examines subjective well-being across extensive and varied Chinese urban and rural environments. We find that the earlier pessimism about China{\textquoteright}s well-being, which emphasized declining happiness, may be misplaced. We make two contributions: first, we show a rising level of subjective well-being, and second, we show that there is a narrowing gap in well-being across different social indicators. Methodologically, we bring in the perspectives of both social capital and geographic context.},

	abstract = {Studies show that women are more risk averse than men. We explore sources and malleability of such differences in a setting where children of two culturally distinct populations, the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han, come together to attend school. Using survey and field experiments, we elicit individual risk attitudes from elementary and middle school students from the two populations. When they first enter school, Mosuo girls take more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls are more risk averse than Han boys, reflecting cultural differences. However, after spending time in the majority-Han environment, Mosuo children adopt the risk preferences of the majority. This shows that risk preferences are shaped by culture and malleable in response to new environments.Many studies find that women are more risk averse than men. Why does such a gender gap exist, and how malleable is this gender gap in risk aversion? The paper takes advantage of a rare setting in which children of the matrilineal Mosuo and the traditionally patriarchal Han attend the same schools in Yunnan, China to shed light on these questions. In particular, we exploit the fact that children would experience a shock in gender norms when they start to intermingle with children from other ethnic groups with the opposite gender norms at school. Using survey and field experiments, we elicit risk attitudes from Mosuo and Han elementary and middle school students. We find that, at the time when they first enter school, Mosuo and Han children exhibit opposite gender norms{\textemdash}Mosuo girls take more risks than Mosuo boys, while Han girls are more risk averse than Han boys, reflecting cultural differences. However, after Mosuo students spend more time with Han students, Mosuo girls become more and more risk averse. By age 11, Mosuo girls are also more risk averse than Mosuo boys. We also observe a shrinking gap in risk aversion for Han over time. Using random roommate assignment for boarding middle school students, we find Mosuo boys who have fewer Mosuo roommates behave more similarly to Han boys. This shows that risk preferences are shaped by culture and malleable in response to new environments.},
