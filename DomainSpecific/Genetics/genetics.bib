	abstract = {Genome-wide association (GWA) mapping is a powerful tool for identification of genetic variants underlying complex traits. However, existing methods typically perform GWA mapping within a single species; methods allowing the description of the genomic landscape of interspecies interactions are only beginning to be developed. Here, we present a method to simultaneously perform GWA mapping on two interacting species. We applied our approach to the Arabidopsis thaliana{\textendash}Xanthomonas arboricola pathosystem and identified candidate genes conferring host{\textendash}pathogen specificity. By integrating the whole-genome sequence data available for pairs of interacting species, we can decipher the genetic architecture of complex traits in finer detail than has previously been possible.Infectious diseases are often affected by specific pairings of hosts and pathogens and therefore by both of their genomes. The integration of a pair of genomes into genome-wide association mapping can provide an exquisitely detailed view of the genetic landscape of complex traits. We present a statistical method, ATOMM (Analysis with a Two-Organism Mixed Model), that maps a trait of interest to a pair of genomes simultaneously; this method makes use of whole-genome sequence data for both host and pathogen organisms. ATOMM uses a two-way mixed-effect model to test for genetic associations and cross-species genetic interactions while accounting for sample structure including interactions between the genetic backgrounds of the two organisms. We demonstrate the applicability of ATOMM to a joint association study of quantitative disease resistance (QDR) in the Arabidopsis thaliana{\textendash}Xanthomonas arboricola pathosystem. Our method uncovers a clear host{\textendash}strain specificity in QDR and provides a powerful approach to identify genetic variants on both genomes that contribute to phenotypic variation.},
