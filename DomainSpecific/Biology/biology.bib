abstract = {A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the viral replication cycle is an individual cell. Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated separately. In this situation the viral genome is not recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral system is functional through complementation across cells. Our observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.},

	abstract = {In nature, self-replication and exponential growth are common. Here we introduce a system of artificial self-replicators based on DNA origami cross-tile motifs. Unlike previous systems based on making a single copy of a parent template, the cross-tile systems, like many natural species, can produce {\textquotedblleft}litters{\textquotedblright} of offspring per generation. The cross-tiles enable a ladder-like structure to crystallize from the template on cooling. UV exposure covalently binds the assembled components of the offspring and heating releases the autonomous daughters from the parent, up to 10 offspring per cycle. The enhanced growth rate speeds up experimental studies and provides an evolutionary advantage for selection.Self-replication and exponential growth are ubiquitous in nature but until recently there were few examples of artificial self-replication. Often replication is a templated process where a parent produces a single offspring, doubling the population in each generation. Many species however produce more than one offspring at a time, enabling faster population growth and higher probability of species perpetuation. We have made a system of cross-shaped origami tiles that yields a number of offspring, four to eight or more, depending on the concentration of monomer units to be assembled. The parent dimer template serves as a seed to crystallize a one-dimensional crystal, a ladder. The ladder rungs are then UV{\textendash}cross-linked and the offspring are then released by heating, to yield a litter of autonomous daughters. In the complement study, we also optimize the growth conditions to speed up the process and yield a 103 increase in the growth rate for the single-offspring replication system. Self-replication and exponential growth of autonomous motifs is useful for fundamental studies of selection and evolution as well as for materials design, fabrication, and directed evolution. Methods that increase the growth rate, the primary evolutionary drive, not only speed up experiments but provide additional mechanisms for evolving materials toward desired functionalities.},

	abstract = {Most living systems, from individual cells to tissues and swarms, display collective self-organization on length scales that are much larger than those of the individual units that drive this organization. A fundamental challenge is to understand how properties of microscopic components determine macroscopic, multicellular biological function. Our study connects intracellular physiology to macroscale collective behaviors during multicellular development, spanning five orders of magnitude in length and six orders of magnitude in time, using bacterial swarming as a model system. This work is enabled by a high-throughput adaptive microscopy technique, which we combined with genetics, machine learning, and mathematical modeling to reveal the phase diagram of bacterial swarming and that cell{\textendash}cell interactions within each swarming phase are dominated by mechanical interactions.Coordinated dynamics of individual components in active matter are an essential aspect of life on all scales. Establishing a comprehensive, causal connection between intracellular, intercellular, and macroscopic behaviors has remained a major challenge due to limitations in data acquisition and analysis techniques suitable for multiscale dynamics. Here, we combine a high-throughput adaptive microscopy approach with machine learning, to identify key biological and physical mechanisms that determine distinct microscopic and macroscopic collective behavior phases which develop as Bacillus subtilis swarms expand over five orders of magnitude in space. Our experiments, continuum modeling, and particle-based simulations reveal that macroscopic swarm expansion is primarily driven by cellular growth kinetics, whereas the microscopic swarming motility phases are dominated by physical cell{\textendash}cell interactions. These results provide a unified understanding of bacterial multiscale behavioral complexity in swarms.},

	abstract = {Desert ants have been shown to use olfaction to pinpoint food and find their nest after far-reaching foraging runs. Here we show that the ants can learn new food and nest odors and that they posses two distinct memories for both contexts. While ants need several training trials to learn a nest odor, and forget about this odor shortly after training has stopped, they learn food odors after one trial, remember them over a lifetime, and can remember at least 14 different food odors. These different memory characteristics make sense, as food is unpredictable and ants might experience many different food items in consecutive foraging runs, while the nest odor will not dramatically change during an ant{\textquoteright}s lifetime.The desert ant Cataglyphis fortis inhabits the North African saltpans where it individually forages for dead arthropods. Homing ants rely mainly on path integration, i.e., the processing of directional information from a skylight compass and distance information from an odometer. Due to the far-reaching foraging runs, path integration is error-prone and guides the ants only to the vicinity of the nest, where the ants then use learned visual and olfactory cues to locate the inconspicuous nest entrance. The learning of odors associated with the nest entrance is well established. We furthermore know that foraging Cataglyphis use the food-derived necromone linoleic acid to pinpoint dead insects. Here we show that Cataglyphis in addition can learn the association of a given odor with food. After experiencing food crumbs that were spiked with an innately neutral odor, ants were strongly attracted by the same odor during their next foraging journey. We therefore explored the characteristics of the ants{\textquoteright} food-odor memory and identified pronounced differences from their memory for nest-associated odors. Nest odors are learned only after repeated learning trials and become ignored as soon as the ants do not experience them at the nest anymore. In contrast, ants learn food odors after a single experience, remember at least 14 consecutively learned food odors, and do so for the rest of their lives. As an ant experiences many food items during its lifetime, but only a single nest, differentially organized memories for both contexts might be adaptive.},

@article{rajakumar2018social,
	Abstract = {The origin of complex worker-caste systems in ants perplexed Darwin1 and has remained an enduring problem for evolutionary and developmental biology2--6. Ants originated approximately 150 million years ago, and produce colonies with winged queen and male castes as well as a wingless worker caste7. In the hyperdiverse genus Pheidole, the wingless worker caste has evolved into two morphologically distinct subcastes---small-headed minor workers and large-headed soldiers8. The wings of queens and males develop from populations of cells in larvae that are called wing imaginal discs7. Although minor workers and soldiers are wingless, vestiges or rudiments of wing imaginal discs appear transiently during soldier development7,9--11. Such rudimentary traits are phylogenetically widespread and are primarily used as evidence of common descent, yet their functional importance remains equivocal1,12--14. Here we show that the growth of rudimentary wing discs is necessary for regulating allometry---disproportionate scaling---between head and body size to generate large-headed soldiers in the genus Pheidole. We also show that Pheidole colonies have evolved the capacity to socially regulate the growth of rudimentary wing discs to control worker subcaste determination, which allows these colonies to maintain the ratio of minor workers to soldiers. Finally, we provide comparative and experimental evidence that suggests that rudimentary wing discs have facilitated the parallel evolution of complex worker-caste systems across the ants. More generally, rudimentary organs may unexpectedly acquire novel regulatory functions during development to facilitate adaptive evolution.},
