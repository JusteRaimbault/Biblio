	abstract = {This work is significant for two reasons. First, considering fly olfaction in the context of a computational algorithm emphasizes features of olfactory processing that might otherwise be less apparent. For example, comparison of prior approaches for novelty detection makes clear that different odors are not just novel vs. familiar, but rather can have various degrees of novelty depending on the similarities between odors. Second, understanding how the fruit fly olfactory circuit detects novel odors can inspire new methods for similar problems in machine learning. In this way, both computer science and neuroscience benefit from the comparison of these two systems.Novelty detection is a fundamental biological problem that organisms must solve to determine whether a given stimulus departs from those previously experienced. In computer science, this problem is solved efficiently using a data structure called a Bloom filter. We found that the fruit fly olfactory circuit evolved a variant of a Bloom filter to assess the novelty of odors. Compared with a traditional Bloom filter, the fly adjusts novelty responses based on two additional features: the similarity of an odor to previously experienced odors and the time elapsed since the odor was last experienced. We elaborate and validate a framework to predict novelty responses of fruit flies to given pairs of odors. We also translate insights from the fly circuit to develop a class of distance- and time-sensitive Bloom filters that outperform prior filters when evaluated on several biological and computational datasets. Overall, our work illuminates the algorithmic basis of an important neurobiological problem and offers strategies for novelty detection in computational systems.},
