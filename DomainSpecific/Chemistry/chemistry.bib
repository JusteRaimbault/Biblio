	abstract = {Formation of clathrate hydrate (CH) requires high pressures and moderate temperatures, which enable their existence in marine sediments and the permafrost region of earth. The presence of CHs in interstellar medium (ISM) is still in question due to the extreme high vacuum and ultracold conditions present there. Here, we conclusively identified methane and carbon dioxide hydrates in conditions analogous to ISM. We found that molecular mobility and interactions play crucial roles in the formation of CHs, even though there is no external pressure to force cage formation. Various chemical processes on these hydrates in ISM may lead to relevant prebiotic molecules.Clathrate hydrates (CHs) are ubiquitous in earth under high-pressure conditions, but their existence in the interstellar medium (ISM) remains unknown. Here, we report experimental observations of the formation of methane and carbon dioxide hydrates in an environment analogous to ISM. Thermal treatment of solid methane and carbon dioxide{\textendash}water mixture in ultrahigh vacuum of the order of 10-10 mbar for extended periods led to the formation of CHs at 30 and 10 K, respectively. High molecular mobility and H bonding play important roles in the entrapment of gases in the in situ formed 512 CH cages. This finding implies that CHs can exist in extreme low-pressure environments present in the ISM. These hydrates in ISM, subjected to various chemical processes, may act as sources for relevant prebiotic molecules.},

	abstract = {Discovering new materials is traditionally a slow process, as the materials genome encompasses a massive parameter space, particularly on the nanoscale where synthesis methods are less universal. To overcome this challenge, a cantilever-free lithography method has been used to deposit millions of discrete nanoreactors on a substrate, which can be transformed into millions of nanoparticles spatially encoded in terms of composition and size. These compositions were screened for their ability to catalytically grow carbon nanotubes, and a composition (Au3Cu) was identified as optimum for this application. More generally, this combinatorial method of synthesizing nanoparticle megalibraries offers researchers a platform for identifying structures with desired properties at a rate not previously possible.The nanomaterial landscape is so vast that a high-throughput combinatorial approach is required to understand structure{\textendash}function relationships. To address this challenge, an approach for the synthesis and screening of megalibraries of unique nanoscale features (\&gt;10,000,000) with tailorable location, size, and composition has been developed. Polymer pen lithography, a parallel lithographic technique, is combined with an ink spray-coating method to create pen arrays, where each pen has a different but deliberately chosen quantity and composition of ink. With this technique, gradients of Au-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized and then screened for activity by in situ Raman spectroscopy with respect to single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) growth. Au3Cu, a composition not previously known to catalyze SWNT growth, has been identified as the most active composition.},
