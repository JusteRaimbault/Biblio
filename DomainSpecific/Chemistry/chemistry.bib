	abstract = {Discovering new materials is traditionally a slow process, as the materials genome encompasses a massive parameter space, particularly on the nanoscale where synthesis methods are less universal. To overcome this challenge, a cantilever-free lithography method has been used to deposit millions of discrete nanoreactors on a substrate, which can be transformed into millions of nanoparticles spatially encoded in terms of composition and size. These compositions were screened for their ability to catalytically grow carbon nanotubes, and a composition (Au3Cu) was identified as optimum for this application. More generally, this combinatorial method of synthesizing nanoparticle megalibraries offers researchers a platform for identifying structures with desired properties at a rate not previously possible.The nanomaterial landscape is so vast that a high-throughput combinatorial approach is required to understand structure{\textendash}function relationships. To address this challenge, an approach for the synthesis and screening of megalibraries of unique nanoscale features (\&gt;10,000,000) with tailorable location, size, and composition has been developed. Polymer pen lithography, a parallel lithographic technique, is combined with an ink spray-coating method to create pen arrays, where each pen has a different but deliberately chosen quantity and composition of ink. With this technique, gradients of Au-Cu bimetallic nanoparticles have been synthesized and then screened for activity by in situ Raman spectroscopy with respect to single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) growth. Au3Cu, a composition not previously known to catalyze SWNT growth, has been identified as the most active composition.},
