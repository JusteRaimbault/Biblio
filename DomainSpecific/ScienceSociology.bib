	abstract = {Mentorship is arguably a scientist{\textquoteright}s most significant collaborative relationship; yet of all collaborations, comparatively little research exists on the link between mentorship and prot{\'e}g{\'e} success. Using new large-scale data from the genealogical and performance records of 10s of thousands of scientists worldwide from 1960 to the present, we found that mentorship is associated with diverse forms of prot{\'e}g{\'e} success, significantly increasing prot{\'e}g{\'e}s{\textquoteright} chances of producing celebrated research, being inducted into the National Academy of Science, and achieving superstardom. Paradoxically, prot{\'e}g{\'e}s achieve their highest impact when they display intellectual independence from their mentors. Prot{\'e}g{\'e}s do their best work when they break from their mentor{\textquoteright}s research topics and coauthor no more than a small portion of their overall research with their mentors.Einstein believed that mentors are especially influential in a prot{\'e}g{\'e}{\textquoteright}s intellectual development, yet the link between mentorship and prot{\'e}g{\'e} success remains a mystery. We marshaled genealogical data on nearly 40,000 scientists who published 1,167,518 papers in biomedicine, chemistry, math, or physics between 1960 and 2017 to investigate the relationship between mentorship and prot{\'e}g{\'e} achievement. In our data, we find groupings of mentors with similar records and reputations who attracted prot{\'e}g{\'e}s of similar talents and expected levels of professional success. However, each grouping has an exception: One mentor has an additional hidden capability that can be mentored to their prot{\'e}g{\'e}s. They display skill in creating and communicating prizewinning research. Because the mentor{\textquoteright}s ability for creating and communicating celebrated research existed before the prize{\textquoteright}s conferment, prot{\'e}g{\'e}s of future prizewinning mentors can be uniquely exposed to mentorship for conducting celebrated research. Our models explain 34{\textendash}44\% of the variance in prot{\'e}g{\'e} success and reveals three main findings. First, mentorship strongly predicts prot{\'e}g{\'e} success across diverse disciplines. Mentorship is associated with a 2{\texttimes}-to-4{\texttimes} rise in a prot{\'e}g{\'e}{\textquoteright}s likelihood of prizewinning, National Academy of Science (NAS) induction, or superstardom relative to matched prot{\'e}g{\'e}s. Second, mentorship is significantly associated with an increase in the probability of prot{\'e}g{\'e}s pioneering their own research topics and being midcareer late bloomers. Third, contrary to conventional thought, prot{\'e}g{\'e}s do not succeed most by following their mentors{\textquoteright} research topics but by studying original topics and coauthoring no more than a small fraction of papers with their mentors.},
