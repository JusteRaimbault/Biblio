	abstract = {Optics is a unique platform to speed up computation, providing advantages especially for inherently parallel operations. Here we demonstrate an optical experiment enabling the simulation of a paradigmatic prototype model for statistical mechanics: the spin glass (SG). SGs are systems presenting all the aspects of complexity, such as many equilibrium states producing multiple relaxation times and nontrivial phenomenology. With the optical approach, the spin state is mapped on the mirrors of a fast adaptive optics device illuminated by a laser, and the energy calculation is performed by collecting the intensity after all the controlled light rays interfered in strongly scattering medium. The optical simulation enables beating the digital calculation in terms of speed for large-sized SG.Spin glasses (SGs) are paradigmatic models for physical, computer science, biological, and social systems. The problem of studying the dynamics for SG models is nondetermistic polynomial-time (NP) hard; that is, no algorithm solves it in polynomial time. Here we implement the optical simulation of an SG, exploiting the N segments of a wavefront-shaping device to play the role of the spin variables, combining the interference downstream of a scattering material to implement the random couplings between the spins (the Jij matrix) and measuring the light intensity on a number P of targets to retrieve the energy of the system. By implementing a plain Metropolis algorithm, we are able to simulate the spin model dynamics, while the degree of complexity of the potential energy landscape and the region of phase diagram explored are user defined, acting on the ratio P/N=α. We study experimentally, numerically, and analytically this Hopfield-like system displaying a paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and SG phase, and we demonstrate that the transition temperature Tg to the glassy phase from the paramagnetic phase grows with α. We demonstrate the computational advantage of the optical SG where interaction terms are realized simultaneously when the independent light rays interfere on the detector{\textquoteright}s surface. This inherently parallel measurement of the energy provides a speedup with respect to purely in silico simulations scaling with N.All study data are included in the article and SI Appendix.},

	abstract = {The speed of a dynamical transition is central to processes across the physical sciences, but general principles to predict and design transition rates within a nonequilibrium system remain elusive. With stochastic thermodynamics, we derive exact relations and inequalities for the ratio of transition rates at and away from thermal equilibrium. We show that excess energy dissipation during the transition imposes an upper limit on the possible speed-up. Amplifying a rate requires a minimum energetic cost{\textemdash}the larger the dissipation, the higher the possible rate amplification. We demonstrate this variational relation on diffusive barrier crossings driven by noisy and deterministic external forces and discuss how it can be leveraged to design optimal protocols for controlling rates in complex random systems.Complex systems can convert energy imparted by nonequilibrium forces to regulate how quickly they transition between long-lived states. While such behavior is ubiquitous in natural and synthetic systems, currently there is no general framework to relate the enhancement of a transition rate to the energy dissipated or to bound the enhancement achievable for a given energy expenditure. We employ recent advances in stochastic thermodynamics to build such a framework, which can be used to gain mechanistic insight into transitions far from equilibrium. We show that under general conditions, there is a basic speed limit relating the typical excess heat dissipated throughout a transition and the rate amplification achievable. We illustrate this tradeoff in canonical examples of diffusive barrier crossings in systems driven with autonomous and deterministic external forcing protocols. In both cases, we find that our speed limit tightly constrains the rate enhancement.Analysis and simulation codes have been deposited in GitHub (https://github.berkeley.edu/ben-kuznets-speck/Dissipation-bounds-the-amplification-of-transition-rates-far-from-equilibrium).},

@article{fruchart2021nonreciprocal,
	abstract = {Out of equilibrium, a lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the exception. Non-reciprocity occurs, for instance, in active matter1--6, non-equilibrium systems7--9, networks of neurons10,11, social groups with conformist and contrarian members12, directional interface growth phenomena13--15 and metamaterials16--20. Although wave propagation in non-reciprocal media has recently been closely studied1,16--20, less is known about the consequences of non-reciprocity on the collective behaviour of many-body systems. Here we show that non-reciprocity leads to time-dependent phases in which spontaneously broken continuous symmetries are dynamically restored. We illustrate this mechanism with simple robotic demonstrations. The resulting phase transitions are controlled by spectral singularities called exceptional points21. We describe the emergence of these phases using insights from bifurcation theory22,23 and non-Hermitian quantum mechanics24,25. Our approach captures non-reciprocal generalizations of three archetypal classes of self-organization out of equilibrium: synchronization, flocking and pattern formation. Collective phenomena in these systems range from active time-(quasi)crystals to exceptional-point-enforced pattern formation and hysteresis. Our work lays the foundation for a general theory of critical phenomena in systems whose dynamics is not governed by an optimization principle.},

	abstract = {Active materials maintained out of equilibrium due to external energy consumption promise access to tunable structures capable of swarming, shape shifting, and self-healing{\textemdash}properties known mostly throughout the biological world. Developing fundamental understanding and controls of these synthetic systems remains challenging. Active colloidal dispersion of rollers energized by an alternating magnetic field reveals complex emergent dynamics of self-organized vortex structures. Reminiscent of the collective behavior observed in living systems, the emergent vortices are well localized in space and unbound from the geometrical constraints. Our findings provide fundamental insight into the emergence of macroscopic behavior in active roller dispersions and suggest strategies for self-assembled dynamic materials and particulate manipulation at the microscale.Active matter, both synthetic and biological, demonstrates complex spatiotemporal self-organization and the emergence of collective behavior. A coherent rotational motion, the vortex phase, is of great interest because of its ability to orchestrate well-organized motion of self-propelled particles over large distances. However, its generation without geometrical confinement has been a challenge. Here, we show by experiments and computational modeling that concentrated magnetic rollers self-organize into multivortex states in an unconfined environment. We find that the neighboring vortices more likely occur with the opposite sense of rotation. Our studies provide insights into the mechanism for the emergence of coherent collective motion on the macroscale from the coupling between microscale rotation and translation of individual active elements. These results may stimulate design strategies for self-assembled dynamic materials and microrobotics.},

	abstract = {Universal properties of quantum (zero-temperature) phase transitions are typically well-described by the classical Landau theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. A paradigmatic counterexample is deconfined criticality, where quantum interference allows for a direct and continuous transition between states with distinct symmetry-breaking patterns, a phenomenon that is classically forbidden. In this work, we extend the scope of deconfined criticality to a case where breaking of a global symmetry coincides with confinement of a local (gauge) symmetry. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate a lattice realization of this transition. Remarkably, we uncover emergent and enlarged global and gauge symmetries. These findings direct us in constructing a critical field theory description.We study a model of fermions on the square lattice at half-filling coupled to an Ising gauge theory that was recently shown in Monte Carlo simulations to exhibit Z2 topological order and massless Dirac fermion excitations. On tuning parameters, a confining phase with broken symmetry (an antiferromagnet in one choice of Hamiltonian) was also established, and the transition between these phases was found to be continuous, with coincident onset of symmetry breaking and confinement. While the confinement transition in pure gauge theories is well-understood in terms of condensing magnetic flux excitations, the same transition in the presence of gapless fermions is a challenging problem owing to the statistical interactions between fermions and the condensing flux excitations. The conventional scenario then proceeds via a two-step transition, involving a symmetry-breaking transition leading to gapped fermions followed by confinement. In contrast, here, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide further evidence for a direct, continuous transition and also find numerical evidence for an enlarged SO(5) symmetry rotating between antiferromagnetism and valence bond solid orders proximate to criticality. Guided by our numerical finding, we develop a field theory description of the direct transition involving an emergent nonabelian [SU(2)] gauge theory and a matrix Higgs field. We contrast our results with the conventional Gross{\textendash}Neveu{\textendash}Yukawa transition.},

	abstract = {Fish and birds moving in groups are thought to benefit from hydrodynamic or aerodynamic interactions between individuals. To better understand these effects, we devise a robotic {\textquotedblleft}school{\textquotedblright} of flapping swimmers whose formations and motions come about from flow interactions. Surprisingly, we find that the flows naturally generated during swimming can also prevent collisions and separations, allowing even uncoordinated individuals with different flapping motions to travel together. Other benefits include freeloading by a {\textquotedblleft}lazy{\textquotedblright} follower who keeps up with a faster-flapping leader by surfing on its wake. More generally, our study provides complete maps linking flapping motions to group locomotion, which is needed to test whether flow interactions are also exploited by animals.Many species of fish and birds travel in groups, yet the role of fluid-mediated interactions in schools and flocks is not fully understood. Previous fluid-dynamical models of these collective behaviors assume that all individuals flap identically, whereas animal groups involve variations across members as well as active modifications of wing or fin motions. To study the roles of flapping kinematics and flow interactions, we design a minimal robotic {\textquotedblleft}school{\textquotedblright} of two hydrofoils swimming in tandem. The flapping kinematics of each foil are independently prescribed and systematically varied, while the forward swimming motions are free and result from the fluid forces. Surprisingly, a pair of uncoordinated foils with dissimilar kinematics can swim together cohesively{\textemdash}without separating or colliding{\textemdash}due to the interaction of the follower with the wake left by the leader. For equal flapping frequencies, the follower experiences stable positions in the leader{\textquoteright}s wake, with locations that can be controlled by flapping amplitude and phase. Further, a follower with lower flapping speed can defy expectation and keep up with the leader, whereas a faster-flapping follower can be buffered from collision and oscillate in the leader{\textquoteright}s wake. We formulate a reduced-order model which produces remarkable agreement with all experimentally observed modes by relating the follower{\textquoteright}s thrust to its flapping speed relative to the wake flow. These results show how flapping kinematics can be used to control locomotion within wakes, and that flow interactions provide a mechanism which promotes group cohesion.},

	abstract = {From intracellular freezing to cloud formation, the crystallization of water is ubiquitous and shapes life as we know it. A full comprehension of the ice nucleation process at the molecular scale remains elusive and we cannot predict where nucleation will occur. Using computational techniques we show that homogeneous nucleation in supercooled water happens in immobile liquid regions that emerge from heterogeneous dynamics. With this we link the topics of nucleation and dynamical heterogeneity and open ways to understand and control heterogeneous nucleation in solution, in confinement, or at interfaces via understanding their effects on liquid dynamics.When an ice crystal is born from liquid water, two key changes occur: (i) The molecules order and (ii) the mobility of the molecules drops as they adopt their lattice positions. Most research on ice nucleation (and crystallization in general) has focused on understanding the former with less attention paid to the latter. However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex dynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon where spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles coexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the nucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here we tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that (i) ice nucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid, (ii) there is a dynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops before any ice-like ordering, and (iii) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics in surrounding water molecules. With this we establish a clear connection between dynamics and nucleation. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way for the examination of the role of dynamical heterogeneities in heterogeneous and solution-based nucleation.},

	abstract = {The complex morphologies of confined skins (e.g., a candy wrapper or a wrinkled elbow) emerge from the generic conflict between their susceptibility to buckling even under minute compression and the unavoidable strain in conforming geometries. Our study of the implications of this conflict leads to the formulation of an effective principle{\textemdash}the Gauss{\textendash}Euler elastica{\textemdash}that characterizes the feasible deformations of thin sheets subject to {\textquotedblleft}geometrically incompatible confinement.{\textquotedblright}The complex morphologies exhibited by spatially confined thin objects have long challenged human efforts to understand and manipulate them, from the representation of patterns in draped fabric in Renaissance art to current-day efforts to engineer flexible sensors that conform to the human body. We introduce a theoretical principle, broadly generalizing Euler{\textquoteright}s elastica{\textemdash}a core concept of continuum mechanics that invokes the energetic preference of bending over straining a thin solid object and that has been widely applied to classical and modern studies of beams and rods. We define a class of geometrically incompatible confinement problems, whereby the topography imposed on a thin solid body is incompatible with its intrinsic ({\textquotedblleft}target{\textquotedblright}) metric and, as a consequence of Gauss{\textquoteright} Theorema Egregium, induces strain. By focusing on a prototypical example of a sheet attached to a spherical substrate, numerical simulations and analytical study demonstrate that the mechanics is governed by a principle, which we call the {\textquotedblleft}Gauss{\textendash}Euler elastica.{\textquotedblright} This emergent rule states that{\textemdash}despite the unavoidable strain in such an incompatible confinement{\textemdash}the ratio between the energies stored in straining and bending the solid may be arbitrarily small. The Gauss{\textendash}Euler elastica underlies a theoretical framework that greatly simplifies the daunting task of solving the highly nonlinear equations that describe thin solids at mechanical equilibrium. This development thus opens possibilities for attacking a broad class of phenomena governed by the coupling of geometry and mechanics.},

In applications to nano- and micromechanical devices, clamped-clamped beams are subjected to relatively large thermal and electronic noise, so that characterizing the fluctuations induced by these effects is an issue of both scientific and technological interest. We pay particular attention to the action of stochastic forces on the stability of internal-resonance motion, showing that resonant oscillations become more robust than other forms of periodic motion as the quality factor of the resonant mode increases.
