	abstract = {Why do humans move the way they do? Here, we obtain a physiologically based theory of the speeds and paths with which humans navigate their environment. We measure the metabolic energy cost of walking with turning and show that minimizing this cost explains diverse phenomena involving navigating around obstacles, walking in complex paths, and turning. We explain why humans slow down while turning, avoid sharp turns, do not always use the shortest path, and other naturalistic locomotor phenomena.Navigating our physical environment requires changing directions and turning. Despite its ecological importance, we do not have a unified theoretical account of non-straight-line human movement. Here, we present a unified optimality criterion that predicts disparate non-straight-line walking phenomena, with straight-line walking as a special case. We first characterized the metabolic cost of turning, deriving the cost landscape as a function of turning radius and rate. We then generalized this cost landscape to arbitrarily complex trajectories, allowing the velocity direction to deviate from body orientation (holonomic walking). We used this generalized optimality criterion to mathematically predict movement patterns in multiple contexts of varying complexity: walking on prescribed paths, turning in place, navigating an angled corridor, navigating freely with end-point constraints, walking through doors, and navigating around obstacles. In these tasks, humans moved at speeds and paths predicted by our optimality criterion, slowing down to turn and never using sharp turns. We show that the shortest path between two points is, counterintuitively, often not energy-optimal, and, indeed, humans do not use the shortest path in such cases. Thus, we have obtained a unified theoretical account that predicts human walking paths and speeds in diverse contexts. Our model focuses on walking in healthy adults; future work could generalize this model to other human populations, other animals, and other locomotor tasks.All study data are included in the article and/or SI Appendix.},
