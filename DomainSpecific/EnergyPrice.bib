title="Spatial variability in retail gasoline markets",
journal="Asia-Pacific Journal of Regional Science",

abstract="Retail gasoline prices continue to be of much interest to the public, with significant economic implications. Of course, pricing too has considerable influence on human behavioral patterns of movement, particularly travel. While national and state gasoline prices may vary, they are largely tied to fairly predictable factors, including the price of crude oil, weather, political stability, and refinery production capabilities, among others. However, local and regional gasoline prices can vary considerably. Capabilities for better understanding and predicting variation in gasoline retail prices are both informative and necessary, particularly with respect to spatial factors. This paper explores characteristics related to gasoline price differences across a region. Of particular interest is assessing price gouging behavior, especially the targeting of disadvantaged groups. A spatial analytic framework that incorporates exploratory spatial data analysis, remote sensing, geographic information systems and spatial statistics is proposed to investigate the impact of local market conditions on regional retail prices of gasoline.",

abstract="Consumers face significantly different gasoline prices across gas stations. Using gasoline price data obtained from 98,753 gas stations within the U.S., it is shown that such differences can be explained by a model utilizing the gasoline demand of consumers depending on their income and commuting distance/time, where the pricing strategies of both gas stations and refiners are taken into account. The corresponding welfare analysis shows that there are significant redistributive effects of gasoline price changes among consumers, where the welfare costs of an increase in gasoline prices are found to be higher for lower income consumers.",
