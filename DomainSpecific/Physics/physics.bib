	abstract = {From intracellular freezing to cloud formation, the crystallization of water is ubiquitous and shapes life as we know it. A full comprehension of the ice nucleation process at the molecular scale remains elusive and we cannot predict where nucleation will occur. Using computational techniques we show that homogeneous nucleation in supercooled water happens in immobile liquid regions that emerge from heterogeneous dynamics. With this we link the topics of nucleation and dynamical heterogeneity and open ways to understand and control heterogeneous nucleation in solution, in confinement, or at interfaces via understanding their effects on liquid dynamics.When an ice crystal is born from liquid water, two key changes occur: (i) The molecules order and (ii) the mobility of the molecules drops as they adopt their lattice positions. Most research on ice nucleation (and crystallization in general) has focused on understanding the former with less attention paid to the latter. However, supercooled water exhibits fascinating and complex dynamical behavior, most notably dynamical heterogeneity (DH), a phenomenon where spatially separated domains of relatively mobile and immobile particles coexist. Strikingly, the microscopic connection between the DH of water and the nucleation of ice has yet to be unraveled directly at the molecular level. Here we tackle this issue via computer simulations which reveal that (i) ice nucleation occurs in low-mobility regions of the liquid, (ii) there is a dynamical incubation period in which the mobility of the molecules drops before any ice-like ordering, and (iii) ice-like clusters cause arrested dynamics in surrounding water molecules. With this we establish a clear connection between dynamics and nucleation. We anticipate that our findings will pave the way for the examination of the role of dynamical heterogeneities in heterogeneous and solution-based nucleation.},

	abstract = {The complex morphologies of confined skins (e.g., a candy wrapper or a wrinkled elbow) emerge from the generic conflict between their susceptibility to buckling even under minute compression and the unavoidable strain in conforming geometries. Our study of the implications of this conflict leads to the formulation of an effective principle{\textemdash}the Gauss{\textendash}Euler elastica{\textemdash}that characterizes the feasible deformations of thin sheets subject to {\textquotedblleft}geometrically incompatible confinement.{\textquotedblright}The complex morphologies exhibited by spatially confined thin objects have long challenged human efforts to understand and manipulate them, from the representation of patterns in draped fabric in Renaissance art to current-day efforts to engineer flexible sensors that conform to the human body. We introduce a theoretical principle, broadly generalizing Euler{\textquoteright}s elastica{\textemdash}a core concept of continuum mechanics that invokes the energetic preference of bending over straining a thin solid object and that has been widely applied to classical and modern studies of beams and rods. We define a class of geometrically incompatible confinement problems, whereby the topography imposed on a thin solid body is incompatible with its intrinsic ({\textquotedblleft}target{\textquotedblright}) metric and, as a consequence of Gauss{\textquoteright} Theorema Egregium, induces strain. By focusing on a prototypical example of a sheet attached to a spherical substrate, numerical simulations and analytical study demonstrate that the mechanics is governed by a principle, which we call the {\textquotedblleft}Gauss{\textendash}Euler elastica.{\textquotedblright} This emergent rule states that{\textemdash}despite the unavoidable strain in such an incompatible confinement{\textemdash}the ratio between the energies stored in straining and bending the solid may be arbitrarily small. The Gauss{\textendash}Euler elastica underlies a theoretical framework that greatly simplifies the daunting task of solving the highly nonlinear equations that describe thin solids at mechanical equilibrium. This development thus opens possibilities for attacking a broad class of phenomena governed by the coupling of geometry and mechanics.},

This system models the internal resonance of two oscillation modes in a vibrating solid beam clamped at both ends. In applications to nano- and micromechanical devices, clamped-clamped beams are subjected to relatively large thermal and electronic noise, so that characterizing the fluctuations induced by these effects is an issue of both scientific and technological interest. We pay particular attention to the action of stochastic forces on the stability of internal-resonance motion, showing that resonant oscillations become more robust than other forms of periodic motion as the quality factor of the resonant mode increases. The dependence on other model parameters --in particular, on the coupling strength between the two oscillators-- is also assessed.},
