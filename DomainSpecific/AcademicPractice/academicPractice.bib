	abstract = {As scientific disciplines grapple with more datasets of rapidly increasing complexity and size, new approaches are urgently required to introduce new statistical and computational tools into research communities and improve the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas. In this paper, we introduce a type of scientific workshop, called a hack week, which allows for fast dissemination of new methodologies into scientific communities and fosters exchange and collaboration within and between disciplines. We present implementations of this concept in astronomy, neuroscience, and geoscience and show that hack weeks produce positive learning outcomes, foster lasting collaborations, yield scientific results, and promote positive attitudes toward open science.Across many scientific disciplines, methods for recording, storing, and analyzing data are rapidly increasing in complexity. Skillfully using data science tools that manage this complexity requires training in new programming languages and frameworks as well as immersion in new modes of interaction that foster data sharing, collaborative software development, and exchange across disciplines. Learning these skills from traditional university curricula can be challenging because most courses are not designed to evolve on time scales that can keep pace with rapidly shifting data science methods. Here, we present the concept of a hack week as an effective model offering opportunities for networking and community building, education in state-of-the-art data science methods, and immersion in collaborative project work. We find that hack weeks are successful at cultivating collaboration and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. Participants self-report that these events help them in both their day-to-day research as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack weeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to positively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster collaboration, and cultivate best practices.},

    abstract = {Workshops are used to explore a specific topic, to transfer knowledge, to solve identified problems, or to create something new. In funded research projects and other research endeavours, workshops are the mechanism used to gather the wider project, community, or interested people together around a particular topic. However, natural questions arise: how do we measure the impact of these workshops? Do we know whether they are meeting the goals and objectives we set for them? What indicators should we use? In response to these questions, this paper will outline rules that will improve the measurement of the impact of workshops.},
