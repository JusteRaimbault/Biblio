    abstract = { Focusing on the challenge of fostering the self-assembly of socio-technical networks, we present the application of Morphogenetic Engineering principles in this domain to a 2D spatial case study involving a team of first responders. Our model and simulation illustrate how members of a rescue team could be guided via hand-held devices toward better coordination and positioning at appropriate locations, based on peer-to-peer communication and local landmarks in the environment (such as incidents or exits), without the need for a centralised control centre. Using Raspberry Pi devices, we illustrate this scenario in various situations that require quick decision-making to control and manage. Our work suggests the possibility of novel forms of bottom-up self-organisation among groups of users and machines, in contrast to top-down imposed hierarchies and policies. },
