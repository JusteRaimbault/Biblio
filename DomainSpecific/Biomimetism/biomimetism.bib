abstract="This study proposes a type of trabecular--honeycomb biomimetic structures with high-efficiency energy-absorbing abilities inspired by beetle elytra. Because the trabecular structure is distributed at the ends of the honeycomb walls, the proposed structure is named an end-trabecular beetle elytron plate crash box, or EBEP crash box for simplification. A comparison between the EBEP crash box and conventional crash box (a buffering structure generally used in modern devices and vehicles) is conducted using compression experiments and finite element method. We present the following results. (1) In contrast to the fluctuation stage with a low force in a conventional crash box, the force--displacement curve of the EBEP crash box possesses a rising stage and an approximate plateau with a higher force; as a result, the absorbing energy ability and compression force efficiency are 5 and 2.6 times greater than those of a conventional crash box, respectively. (2) Experimental and numerical comparisons reveal that there is cracking failure in the conventional crash box; however, the coordinated and uniform S-typed laminated compression deformation is developed in the EBEP crash box. (3) The influences of the amplitude (A) of the sine wave deformation line on the peak force and the compression force efficiency of the EBEP crash box are investigated, thereby providing a feasible method for adjusting the peak force according to different engineering requirements. These results provide new inspiration for applying EBEP crash boxes and exploiting new buffering structures and materials in the energy-absorbing field.",

	abstract = {The search for general common principles that unify disciplines is a longstanding challenge for interdisciplinary research. Architecture has always been an interdisciplinary pursuit, combining engineering, art and culture. The rise of biomimetic architecture adds to the interdisciplinary span. We discuss the similarities and differences among human and animal societies in how architecture influences their collective behaviour. We argue that the emergence of a fully biomimetic architecture involves breaking down what we call {\textquoteleft}pernicious dualities{\textquoteright} that have permeated our discourse for decades, artificial divisions between species, between organism and environment, between genotype and phenotype, and in the case of architecture, the supposed duality between the built environment and its builders. We suggest that niche construction theory may serve as a starting point for unifying our thinking across disciplines, taxa and spatial scales.This article is part of the theme issue {\textquoteleft}Interdisciplinary approaches for uncovering the impacts of architecture on collective behaviour{\textquoteright}.},

	abstract = {Built structures, such as animal nests or buildings that humans occupy, serve two overarching purposes: shelter and a space where individuals interact. The former has dominated much of the discussion in the literature. But, as the study of collective behaviour expands, it is time to elucidate the role of the built environment in shaping collective outcomes. Collective behaviour in social animals emerges from interactions, and collective cognition in humans emerges from communication and coordination. These collective actions have vast economic implications in human societies and critical fitness consequences in animal systems. Despite the obvious influence of space on interactions, because spatial proximity is necessary for an interaction to occur, spatial constraints are rarely considered in studies of collective behaviour or collective cognition. An interdisciplinary exchange between behavioural ecologists, evolutionary biologists, cognitive scientists, social scientists, architects and engineers can facilitate a productive exchange of ideas, methods and theory that could lead us to uncover unifying principles and novel research approaches and questions in studies of animal and human collective behaviour. This article, along with those in this theme issue aims to formalize and catalyse this interdisciplinary exchange.This article is part of the theme issue {\textquoteleft}Interdisciplinary approaches for uncovering the impacts of architecture on collective behaviour{\textquoteright}.},

	abstract = {The similarities between the structures built by social insects and by humans have led to a convergence of interests between biologists and architects. This new, de facto interdisciplinary community of scholars needs a common terminology and theoretical framework in which to ground its work. In this conceptually oriented review paper, we review the terms {\textquoteleft}information{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteleft}space{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}architecture{\textquoteright} to provide definitions that span biology and architecture. A framework is proposed on which interdisciplinary exchange may be better served, with the view that this will aid better cross-fertilization between disciplines, working in the areas of collective behaviour and analysis of the structures and edifices constructed by non-humans; and to facilitate how this area of study may better contribute to the field of architecture. We then use these definitions to discuss the informational content of constructions built by organisms and the influence these have on behaviour, and vice versa. We review how spatial constraints inform and influence interaction between an organism and its environment, and examine the reciprocity of space and information on construction and the behaviour of humans and social insects.This article is part of the theme issue {\textquoteleft}Interdisciplinary approaches for uncovering the impacts of architecture on collective behaviour{\textquoteright}.},
