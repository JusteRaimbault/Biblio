	abstract = {How does an organism{\textquoteright}s genetic sequence govern its measurable characteristics? New technologies provide libraries of randomized sequences to study this relationship in unprecedented detail for proteins and other molecules. Deriving insight from these data is difficult, though, because the space of possible sequences is enormous, so even the largest experiments sample a tiny minority of sequences. Moreover, the effects of mutations may combine in unexpected ways. We present a statistical framework to analyze such mutagenesis data. The key assumption is that mutations contribute in a simple way to some unobserved trait, which is related to the observed trait by a nonlinear mapping. Analyzing three proteins, we show that this model is easily interpretable and yet fits the data remarkably well.Genotype{\textendash}phenotype relationships are notoriously complicated. Idiosyncratic interactions between specific combinations of mutations occur and are difficult to predict. Yet it is increasingly clear that many interactions can be understood in terms of global epistasis. That is, mutations may act additively on some underlying, unobserved trait, and this trait is then transformed via a nonlinear function to the observed phenotype as a result of subsequent biophysical and cellular processes. Here we infer the shape of such global epistasis in three proteins, based on published high-throughput mutagenesis data. To do so, we develop a maximum-likelihood inference procedure using a flexible family of monotonic nonlinear functions spanned by an I-spline basis. Our analysis uncovers dramatic nonlinearities in all three proteins; in some proteins a model with global epistasis accounts for virtually all of the measured variation, whereas in others we find substantial local epistasis as well. This method allows us to test hypotheses about the form of global epistasis and to distinguish variance components attributable to global epistasis, local epistasis, and measurement error.},

	abstract = {Using artificial selection on fruit fly pheromones, we tested how mate choice by both sexes can cause evolutionary change. Results show that although both sexes choose mates, the evolutionary outcomes are fundamentally different for each sex. Specifically, experimental results show that the evolution of pheromones can only be driven through female choice of males because genetic relationships exist between pheromones, mating success, and fitness. Male choice of females, however, cannot drive evolutionary change by itself because the correlation between pheromones and mating success is generated by environmental rather than genetic variation. Therefore, the traits targeted in females by male choice are likely to evolve through correlated responses to selection on males.Mutual mate choice occurs when males and females base mating decisions on shared traits. Despite increased awareness, the extent to which mutual choice drives phenotypic change remains poorly understood. When preferences in both sexes target the same traits, it is unclear how evolution will proceed and whether responses to sexual selection from male choice will match or oppose responses to female choice. Answering this question is challenging, as it requires understanding, genetic relationships between the traits targeted by choice, mating success, and, ultimately, fitness for both sexes. Addressing this, we applied artificial selection to the cuticular hydrocarbons of the fly Drosophila serrata that are targeted by mutual choice and tracked evolutionary changes in males and females alongside changes in mating success. After 10 generations, significant trait evolution occurred in both sexes, but intriguingly there were major sex differences in the associated fitness consequences. Sexually selected trait evolution in males led to a genetically based increase in male mating success. By contrast, although trait evolution also occurred in females, there was no change in mating success. Our results suggest that phenotypic sexual selection on females from male choice is environmentally, rather than genetically, generated. Thus, compared with female choice, male choice is at best a weak driver of signal trait evolution in this species. Instead, the evolution of apparent female ornamentation seems more likely due to a correlated response to sexual selection on males and possibly other forms of natural selection.},
