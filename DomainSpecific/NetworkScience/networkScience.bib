	abstract = {Spectral graph clustering{\textemdash}clustering the vertices of a graph based on their spectral embedding{\textemdash}is of significant current interest, finding applications throughout the sciences. But as with clustering in general, what a particular methodology identifies as {\textquotedblleft}clusters{\textquotedblright} is defined (explicitly, or, more often, implicitly) by the clustering algorithm itself. We provide a clear and concise demonstration of a {\textquotedblleft}two-truths{\textquotedblright} phenomenon for spectral graph clustering in which the first step{\textemdash}spectral embedding{\textemdash}is either Laplacian spectral embedding, wherein one decomposes the normalized Laplacian of the adjacency matrix, or adjacency spectral embedding given by a decomposition of the adjacency matrix itself. The two resulting clustering methods identify fundamentally different (true and meaningful) structure.Clustering is concerned with coherently grouping observations without any explicit concept of true groupings. Spectral graph clustering{\textemdash}clustering the vertices of a graph based on their spectral embedding{\textemdash}is commonly approached via K-means (or, more generally, Gaussian mixture model) clustering composed with either Laplacian spectral embedding (LSE) or adjacency spectral embedding (ASE). Recent theoretical results provide deeper understanding of the problem and solutions and lead us to a {\textquotedblleft}two-truths{\textquotedblright} LSE vs. ASE spectral graph clustering phenomenon convincingly illustrated here via a diffusion MRI connectome dataset: The different embedding methods yield different clustering results, with LSE capturing left hemisphere/right hemisphere affinity structure and ASE capturing gray matter/white matter core{\textendash}periphery structure.},

	abstract = {The proper functioning of many sociotechnical systems depends on their level of connectivity. By removing or deactivating a specific set of nodes, a network structure can be dismantled into isolated subcomponents, thereby disrupting the malfunctioning of a system or containing the spread of misinformation or an epidemic. We propose a generalized network-dismantling framework, which can take realistic removal costs into account such as the node price, the protection level, or removal energy. We discuss applications of cost-efficient dismantling strategies to real-world problems such as containing an epidemic or dismantling criminal or corruption networks.Finding an optimal subset of nodes in a network that is able to efficiently disrupt the functioning of a corrupt or criminal organization or contain an epidemic or the spread of misinformation is a highly relevant problem of network science. In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a fine-tuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems.},

	abstract = {Functionally optimized networks are ubiquitous in nature, e.g., in allosteric proteins that change conformation upon binding to a ligand or vascular networks that distribute oxygen and nutrients in animals or plants. Many of these networks are multifunctional, with proteins that can catalyze more than one substrate or vascular networks that can deliver enhanced flow to more than one localized region of the network. This work investigates the question of how many simultaneous functions a given network can be designed to fulfill, uncovering a phase transition that is related to other constraint{\textendash}satisfaction transitions such as the jamming transition.Nature is rife with networks that are functionally optimized to propagate inputs to perform specific tasks. Whether via genetic evolution or dynamic adaptation, many networks create functionality by locally tuning interactions between nodes. Here we explore this behavior in two contexts: strain propagation in mechanical networks and pressure redistribution in flow networks. By adding and removing links, we are able to optimize both types of networks to perform specific functions. We define a single function as a tuned response of a single {\textquotedblleft}target{\textquotedblright} link when another, predetermined part of the network is activated. Using network structures generated via such optimization, we investigate how many simultaneous functions such networks can be programed to fulfill. We find that both flow and mechanical networks display qualitatively similar phase transitions in the number of targets that can be tuned, along with the same robust finite-size scaling behavior. We discuss how these properties can be understood in the context of constraint{\textendash}satisfaction problems.},

	abstract = {Networks provide a powerful abstraction for complex systems throughout the sciences by representing the underlying set of pairwise interactions, but much of the structure within these systems involves interactions that take place among more than two nodes at once. While these higher-order interactions are ubiquitous, an evaluation of the basic properties and organizational principles in such systems is missing. Here we study 19 datasets from biology, medicine, social networks, and the web and characterize how higher-order structure emerges and differs between domains. We then propose a general framework for evaluating higher-order data models based on link prediction, a task in which we seek to predict future interactions from a system{\textquoteright}s structure and past history.Networks provide a powerful formalism for modeling complex systems by using a model of pairwise interactions. But much of the structure within these systems involves interactions that take place among more than two nodes at once{\textemdash}for example, communication within a group rather than person to person, collaboration among a team rather than a pair of coauthors, or biological interaction between a set of molecules rather than just two. Such higher-order interactions are ubiquitous, but their empirical study has received limited attention, and little is known about possible organizational principles of such structures. Here we study the temporal evolution of 19 datasets with explicit accounting for higher-order interactions. We show that there is a rich variety of structure in our datasets but datasets from the same system types have consistent patterns of higher-order structure. Furthermore, we find that tie strength and edge density are competing positive indicators of higher-order organization, and these trends are consistent across interactions involving differing numbers of nodes. To systematically further the study of theories for such higher-order structures, we propose higher-order link prediction as a benchmark problem to assess models and algorithms that predict higher-order structure. We find a fundamental difference from traditional pairwise link prediction, with a greater role for local rather than long-range information in predicting the appearance of new interactions.},

abstract="Understanding the importance of links in transmitting information in a network can provide ways to hinder or postpone ongoing dynamical phenomena like the spreading of epidemic or the diffusion of information. In this work, we propose a new measure based on stochastic diffusion processes, the transmission centrality, that captures the importance of links by estimating the average number of nodes to whom they transfer information during a global spreading diffusion process. We propose a simple algorithmic solution to compute transmission centrality and to approximate it in very large networks at low computational cost. Finally we apply transmission centrality in the identification of weak ties in three large empirical social networks, showing that this metric outperforms other centrality measures in identifying links that drive spreading processes in a social network.",

	abstract = {Much work has focused on phase transitions in complex networks in which the system transitions from a resilient to a failed state. Furthermore, many of these networks have a community structure, whose effects on resilience have not yet been fully understood. Here, we show that the community structure can significantly affect the resilience of the system in that it removes the phase transition present in a single module, and the network remains resilient at this transition. In particular, we show that the effect of increasing interconnections is analogous to increasing external magnetic field in spin systems. Our findings provide insight into the resilience of many modular complex systems and clarify the important effects that community structure has on network resilience.Although detecting and characterizing community structure is key in the study of networked systems, we still do not understand how community structure affects systemic resilience and stability. We use percolation theory to develop a framework for studying the resilience of networks with a community structure. We find both analytically and numerically that interlinks (the connections among communities) affect the percolation phase transition in a way similar to an external field in a ferromagnetic{\textendash} paramagnetic spin system. We also study universality class by defining the analogous critical exponents δ and γ, and we find that their values in various models and in real-world coauthor networks follow the fundamental scaling relations found in physical phase transitions. The methodology and results presented here facilitate the study of network resilience and also provide a way to understand phase transitions under external fields.},

	abstract = {The development of high-throughput technologies has allowed mapping a significant proportion of interactions between biochemical entities in the cell. However, it is unclear how much information is lost given the lack of measurements on the kinetic parameters governing the dynamics of these interactions. Using biochemical networks with experimentally measured kinetic parameters, we show that a knowledge of the network topology offers 65{\textendash}80\% accuracy in predicting the impact of perturbation patterns. In other words, we can use the increasingly accurate topological models to approximate perturbation patterns, bypassing expensive kinetic constant measurement. These results could open new avenues in modeling drug action and in identifying drug targets relying on the human interactome only.High-throughput technologies, offering an unprecedented wealth of quantitative data underlying the makeup of living systems, are changing biology. Notably, the systematic mapping of the relationships between biochemical entities has fueled the rapid development of network biology, offering a suitable framework to describe disease phenotypes and predict potential drug targets. However, our ability to develop accurate dynamical models remains limited, due in part to the limited knowledge of the kinetic parameters underlying these interactions. Here, we explore the degree to which we can make reasonably accurate predictions in the absence of the kinetic parameters. We find that simple dynamically agnostic models are sufficient to recover the strength and sign of the biochemical perturbation patterns observed in 87 biological models for which the underlying kinetics are known. Surprisingly, a simple distance-based model achieves 65\% accuracy. We show that this predictive power is robust to topological and kinetic parameter perturbations, and we identify key network properties that can increase up to 80\% the recovery rate of the true perturbation patterns. We validate our approach using experimental data on the chemotactic pathway in bacteria, finding that a network model of perturbation spreading predicts with \~{}80\% accuracy the directionality of gene expression and phenotype changes in knock-out and overproduction experiments. These findings show that the steady advances in mapping out the topology of biochemical interaction networks opens avenues for accurate perturbation spread modeling, with direct implications for medicine and drug development.},

  abstract = {The betweenness centrality, a path-based global measure of flow, is a static predictor of congestion and load on networks. Here we demonstrate that its statistical distribution is invariant for planar networks, that are used to model many infrastructural and biological systems. Empirical analysis of street networks from 97 cities worldwide, along with simulations of random planar graph models, indicates the observed invariance to be a consequence of a bimodal regime consisting of an underlying tree structure for high betweenness nodes, and a low betweenness regime corresponding to loops providing local path alternatives. Furthermore, the high betweenness nodes display a non-trivial spatial clustering with increasing spatial correlation as a function of the edge-density. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of betweenness is a more accurate discriminator than its statistics for comparing  static congestion patterns and  its evolution across cities as demonstrated by analyzing 200 years of street data for Paris.},
