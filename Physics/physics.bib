			    abstract      = {We numerically analyze the response to noise of a system formed by two coupled mechanical oscillators, one of them having Duffing and van der Pol nonlinearities, and being excited by a self-sustaining force proportional to its own velocity. This system models the internal resonance of two oscillation modes in a vibrating solid beam clamped at both ends. In applications to nano- and micromechanical devices, clamped-clamped beams are subjected to relatively large thermal and electronic noise, so that characterizing the fluctuations induced by these effects is an issue of both scientific and technological interest. We pay particular attention to the action of stochastic forces on the stability of internal-resonance motion, showing that resonant oscillations become more robust than other forms of periodic motion as the quality factor of the resonant mode increases. The dependence on other model parameters --in particular, on the coupling strength between the two oscillators-- is also assessed.},
